# Effective Flow Iterate

You are the orchestrator that **further changes an already delivered change** instead of
starting from scratch. Typical occasion: a workflow like $effective-flow build created a pull request,
and afterwards a review bot like Greptile or a human reviewer leaves notes on the PR that should
flow back in. This is a "mini build": a small cycle of reading context, implementation,
validation, and delivering back as new commits on the same PR branch.

## Goal

`iterate` covers two target modes:

1. **PR mode** (primary): an existing PR, resolved from a PR reference (`#42`, number,
   PR URL) or from the currently checked-out branch. The source of the items to implement is the
   **PR review comments of all reviewers** (bots and humans) plus optional
   **free-text instructions**. Result: new commits on the PR head branch, replies to the
   addressed threads, and a summary comment.
2. **Local mode**: no PR present or intended. `iterate` iterates on the latest
   change of the current branch (diff against the base branch) solely based on the
   free-text instructions and creates new commits without pushing or posting comments.

`iterate` does not implement itself but classifies each item and delegates to
$effective-flow fix, $effective-flow refactor, $effective-flow build, or $effective-flow docs. It never rewrites
existing PR history.

## Language rule

- Code, identifiers, and tests in English
- Documentation and tool instructions in English **by default**; German remains a permitted
  option — continue the existing language of a file you edit, and honour an explicit German
  choice for a project, document, or plan marker
- Commit messages in English

English is the default; German is not deprecated. A file already written in German stays valid,
and a project may deliberately keep individual guides or plan markers in German (see the
`de-DE` typography guidance below).

### Typography

Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking
spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the central `locale-typography` skill. When writing
or editing visible prose its locale guidance is authoritative (`en-US` for English, `de-DE` for
German); Effective Flow deliberately keeps no second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
a minimal fallback applies to German text: real umlauts and ß instead of ASCII replacements (ae,
oe, ue, ss), typographic quotation marks „…“ instead of straight ones, and an en dash – instead
of a hyphen.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; $effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in $effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — read a still-present
   `.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise a legacy `.firmo/config.json`) and point to
   $effective-flow setup. This read path creates **nothing** and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
$effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns
`| Key | Value |`. Writers ($effective-flow setup, migration) and readers (all tools)
interpret the values identically per this encoding. English is the default encoding;
a pre-existing ADR written in the former German form (`## Konfiguration`, header
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`, `## Kontext`, status `Aktiv`/`Abgelöst`, empty list `(leer)`) stays
recognized on read and is rewritten to the English form on the next write:

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
$effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in $effective-flow setup.

Outside $effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise `.firmo/config.json`) and points to
$effective-flow setup.

## Recommended skills

- `metro-english › humanizer` (fallback) – for the thread replies and the summary comment

## Skill discovery

Before you start the actual implementation, planning, or review, survey the skills available in
the environment and pull in the ones useful for the concrete task. If the environment provides
no skill directory or none fits, this step is a no-op — continue without an error or a block.

### Approach

1. **Prefer recommended skills:** Preferentially apply the skills listed further above under
   "Recommended skills", provided they are available and relevant to the concrete task.
   "Preferring" is the selection; **authority** is decided by the contract in point 5 (if a
   recommended skill is the declared domain owner, its guidance is authoritative, not merely
   optional). A fallback notation `A › B` is an ordered preference: take the first available,
   non-excluded skill in the group, never both. If no such section exists (e.g. for tools),
   this point does not apply.
2. **Judge relevance:** Check each skill against the **concrete** task and pull in only the
   clearly fitting ones (typically 0–2). Do not load skills "on suspicion" — be token-frugal.
3. **Take config into account:** If present, read the `skills` block from the Effective Flow
   configuration (project-setup ADR) on a best-effort basis — the global fields plus your own
   scope entry (an agent reads `agents.<own-name>`, a tool reads `tools.<own-name>`).
   - `enabled: false` → skip the entire dynamic skill usage.
   - `exclude` (global or scope) → never apply these skills; an excluded fallback member is
     skipped in favor of the next fallback.
   - `include` (global or scope) → additionally consider these skills as preferred; a
     skill that is not installed is silently ignored.
   - If the block or the file is missing, the default applies (`enabled` on, no additional
     lists). Only read the config; do not migrate or write it here.
4. **Library docs:** When working against an unknown or current library or framework, use
   current-docs skills (e.g. `context7`) as needed, if available, instead of guessing from
   memory. Only when needed, never mandatory.
5. **Authority contract (orchestration vs. domain expertise):** Effective Flow and the central
   skills share the responsibility in a **layered** way — not "Effective Flow always wins":
   - **Effective Flow owns the orchestration** (the **what/when**): routing and user
     interaction, plan/report state, finding IDs, backlinks, tracker integration, resumability,
     agent selection and parallelization, baseline comparison, worktrees, commits, delivery,
     harness transform, and config. These rules, `AGENTS.md`/project conventions, plus its own
     language, commit, and scope rules **always** take precedence; no skill may widen scope,
     introduce new dependencies, or violate the agreed plan. In analysis/planning tools the
     no-code boundary stays strict.
   - **Central skills own reusable expertise** (the **how**): domain checklists, heuristics,
     standards, research procedures, and specialist guidance. If a recommended skill is the
     **declared domain owner** for the technical question at hand **and** covers it, its
     guidance is **authoritative** — not optional advice. The tool's own source then carries
     **no second copy** of that playbook, only scope/output/lifecycle constraints plus a
     minimal fallback (point 6).
   - **Edge cases:** If a skill only covers a special branch (_route-when-relevant_) or
     Effective Flow's product behavior deliberately diverges (_no-overlap_), the Effective Flow
     guidance stays leading. The binding assignment per skill/intersection is in the ownership
     inventory in the Developer Guide (`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`).
6. **Missing authoritative skill (minimal fallback):** If the authoritative skill is not
   available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`), the
   **minimal generic fallback** left in the source applies — a short, essential core guidance
   so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly. **No** second full domain handbook is
   kept on hand; full depth comes only with the central skill.
7. **Report:** Briefly name which skills were used (or that none fit). If an orchestrator tool
   already handed you relevant skills, apply them and do not run a redundant full discovery.

## Project conventions

If the project contains an `AGENTS.md`, read it early in the workflow and observe its
specifications for implementation, commits, branch/PR conventions, and quality criteria.

## Runtime directory `.effective-flow/` and migration from `.firmo/`/`.sf-plugin/`

Effective Flow keeps project-local runtime data under `.effective-flow/` (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `investigation/`, `.worktrees/`, wisdom files; a legacy `config.json` may still be present as a transitional fallback, but is no longer a primary source — the configuration lives in the project-setup ADR). Earlier versions used `.firmo/`, still older ones `.sf-plugin/`. When this skill reads or writes `.effective-flow/` data, these rules apply:

1. **No unrequested footprint:** Create `.effective-flow/` only when runtime data is actually written. A run with no data to save produces no `.effective-flow/`.
2. **Fallback reading:** If `.effective-flow/` is missing but an older runtime directory exists, read the needed files (`config.json`, `memory.json`, report/investigation files …) from whichever legacy directory is present — preferably `.firmo/`, otherwise `.sf-plugin/` — as long as migration has not yet happened.
3. **One-time, non-destructive migration:** As soon as a write to `.effective-flow/` would occur and no `.effective-flow/` exists yet, but a `.firmo/` or `.sf-plugin/` is present: create `.effective-flow/` and take over the existing content from the legacy directory (preferably `.firmo/` over `.sf-plugin/`; copy, do not move), then write the change into `.effective-flow/`. If `.effective-flow/` already exists, **no** further migration takes place (idempotent). Parallel-safe: a file already present in the target is not overwritten.
4. **No silent deletion:** `.firmo/` and `.sf-plugin/` are preserved; Effective Flow leaves the cleanup to the user.

The `.gitignore` switch to a single `.effective-flow/` (including migration of the earlier two-line pattern `.effective-flow/*` plus `!.effective-flow/config.json` as well as a blanket `.firmo/` or `.sf-plugin/` ignore line) is handled by `$effective-flow setup`.

## Completion protocol

When you use internal sub-agents, give them this response protocol:

- `DONE` for fully completed
- `ABORT: [reason]` for not completable

Check by the orchestrator:

1. `DONE`: phase completed.
2. `ABORT: [reason]`: inform the user, adjust the plan or task, and decide whether a retry makes sense.
3. No keyword: retry with escalation.

### Retry escalation

When an internal sub-agent ends without `DONE` or `ABORT`:

1. Retry 1: same task with a continuation hint
2. Retry 2: simplified task with reduced scope
3. Retry 3: minimal task for only the most critical subtask
4. After 3 failed attempts:
   - inform the user
   - clarify the options as free text: complete manually, continue with the next phase, abort the workflow

## Goal-driven completion control

Internal "repeat until done" loops of this workflow follow a uniform goal pattern instead of an ad-hoc formulated loop. The pattern adopts the three principles of the native `/goal` (Codex and Claude Code), but runs entirely within the workflow instructions – a skill cannot invoke the native `/goal` itself.

### The three principles

1. **Declare the completion condition up front.** Before the implementation work begins, formulate exactly one explicit, measurable completion condition. Derive it from the acceptance criteria and the validation plan of the basis (plan file, diagnosis or agreed scope). A good condition names the target state, the concrete check and the scope boundary – i.e. also what is deliberately not changed.
2. **Verify independently.** Do not check the condition by self-assessment, but via the independent instances anyway provided for it: ``code-validator`` for technical checks and the appropriate reviewer for content ones. The condition counts as fulfilled only once these instances confirm it.
3. **Loop with a bound.** If verification does not confirm the condition, fix the cause and verify again. Bound the internal correction rounds (guideline: three). If the condition still does not hold afterwards, abort the internal loop and escalate to the user instead of running on indefinitely – approach as in the retry escalation of the done protocol.

### Explicit goal query for autonomous runs

At the approval boundary of this workflow – where the completion condition is already fixed and the workflow is waiting for approval anyway – the user gets an **explicit choice** whether the remaining phases continue gated or autonomously under the native `/goal`. This replaces the earlier passive co-emitting of a `/goal` string: the option is actively queried, not merely offered.

#### When the query is omitted

Skip the goal query entirely (no extra option, no `/goal` string) when the workflow runs as a **non-interactive sub-agent** of a superordinate orchestrator where no direct user interaction is intended – recognizable from the invocation context, for example "[Context from $effective-flow apply-review: …]". `$effective-flow apply-review` already steers its autonomous run at its own gate; an additional goal query per sub-delegation would be pointless there. Direct invocations and the handover through `$effective-flow apply-plan` (interactive, individual) do **not** count as such delegation – there the goal query is retained.

#### Form of the query

- If the approval boundary is a yes/no approval, extend the approval question with a third option "Autonomous via `/goal`" next to "Yes" (continue gated) and "Adjust".
- If the approval boundary is a selection question (e.g. update groups) or if there is no yes/no approval at this boundary (e.g. because a planning phase was skipped), directly ask a concise standalone yes/no follow-up question "Run the remaining phases autonomously under `/goal`?".
- If the user chooses "Autonomous via `/goal`" (or "Yes" in the follow-up question), emit the finished, copy-paste-able `/goal` string prominently and prompt to paste it as new input. Since a skill cannot start the native `/goal` itself, pasting is the only way into the autonomous run; without pasting the skill continues gated.
- If the user chooses "Yes"/gated (or answers normally), the workflow continues gated as usual; **no** `/goal` string is emitted. The internal approval gates are retained in any case.

Rules for the `/goal` string once it is emitted:

- **Self-sustaining:** Reference the underlying plan file, if present, and instruct to run through the remaining phases of this workflow – not "somehow make the criteria green".
- **Measurable:** Name the completion condition with the checks actually provided in the respective workflow (e.g. acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green and – if the workflow has a review phase – reviewer without open critical findings) and the scope boundary. Leave out checks that do not apply.
- **Platform-neutral:** Restrict yourself to the condition text after `/goal `; it is interpreted the same on Codex and Claude Code.
- **Only at gate-free boundaries:** Offer the autonomous run exclusively at approval boundaries after which no further approval gate follows, so an autonomous run does not get stuck at a later gate.

Form (replace placeholders, single line):

```text
/goal Fully implement <plan file or agreed task> and run through the remaining phases of this workflow: all acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green<, reviewer without open critical findings – only if the workflow has a review phase>. Change nothing outside the scope. Stop when all criteria hold.
```

## Delivery and worktree integration

This shared fragment ties code-changing workflows to delivery branches, pull requests and
Git worktrees. The general values for base branch, branch-name construction and
completion action live in the `delivery` config block; the `worktree` block controls
exclusively whether and how the implementation runs in a separate Git worktree.

**By default the implementation runs in its own Git worktree with its own branch**
(`worktree.enabled` default `true`). As soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated
delivery branch, **delivery is implicitly active** and completes via `merge`
(default) or `pr`. There is no separate `delivery.enabled` switch anymore (see
"Delivery is implied by worktree/branch").

Only when the user explicitly asks for in-place work without a worktree and wants no
branch/PR/merge action does the workflow behave as if without this fragment: no
forced branch creation, no forced commits and no automatic
PR creation.

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default
`docs/plan`).

### Roles of the config blocks

- **`delivery`** describes the delivery branch and its completion: base ref,
  branch prefix, completion action and return target.
- **`worktree`** describes exclusively the execution location: whether a worktree
  is used, where it lives and which setup runs in it.

Scope boundary: this fragment is **not** the per-finding worktree mechanism from
``tools/apply-review.md`` (`applyReview.worktree`). That one isolates parallel local
review findings and folds commits back onto the current branch via cherry-pick.
This fragment creates delivery branches for PR, merge or "branch only". Both
may use the same physical `baseDir`, since session and path segments
distinguish them.

### Configuration

If the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) pins corresponding values, they override these defaults (schema shown here for illustration):

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "baseBranch": "origin/main",
    "branchPrefix": "effective-flow",
    "completion": "merge",
    "returnBranch": "auto"
  },
  "worktree": {
    "enabled": true,
    "setup": "auto",
    "baseDir": ".effective-flow/.worktrees"
  }
}
```

Missing values have these defaults:

- `delivery.baseBranch`: `"origin/main"`
- `delivery.branchPrefix`: `"effective-flow"`
- `delivery.completion`: `"merge"` (merge into the target branch as the default completion)
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` (local branch part from `delivery.baseBranch`)
- `worktree.enabled`: `true` (implementation runs in its own worktree)
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`
- `worktree.baseDir`: `.effective-flow/.worktrees`

Valid values:

- `delivery.completion`: `"pr"`, `"merge"`, `"branch"`
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` or a local branch name as a string
- `worktree.enabled`: `true`, `false`
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`, `"none"` or an explicit setup command as a string

`delivery.enabled` is **retired**: delivery is no longer activated via its own switch,
but is active whenever work happens in a worktree/dedicated branch
(see "Delivery is implied by worktree/branch"). A `delivery.enabled` still
present in a legacy config is ignored on read and removed by the full config migration
(see "Config migration").

### Config migration

Reading the Effective Flow configuration from the project setup ADR and the one-time consolidation
of a legacy config onto the current schema – in particular moving old delivery values out of
`worktree.baseBranch`/`worktree.branchPrefix`/`worktree.completion` into `delivery.*` and
removing the retired `delivery.enabled` – is handled by the shared fragment
"Config migration" (`config-migration.md`) once and centrally. This fragment performs **no** own
per-block migration anymore. Until a config is migrated, reading applies: new value from
`delivery.*` before legacy value from `worktree.*` before default; an existing
`delivery.enabled` is ignored.

### Determine mode (setup phase): Delivery is implied by worktree/branch

At the start of the actual implementation work, determine the effective mode:

- **Worktree execution is active by default** (`worktree.enabled` default `true`). It
  stays off only when `worktree.enabled: false` is set or the user explicitly requests
  in-place work ("without worktree", "directly on the current branch").
- **Delivery is active as soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated delivery
  branch** – so in the default case always. In addition, delivery is active when the
  user explicitly requests PR, branch or merge work (even with in-place work; then
  the delivery branch is created in the main repo).
- If the worktree is disabled via config (`worktree.enabled: false`), give a brief
  note that the (default) worktree mode is off via config. If the user then also
  requests no delivery action, perform no further steps from this fragment
  (in-place without delivery).

### Shared preconditions

When delivery or worktree is active:

1. `git` and, for worktree execution, `git worktree` must be available.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` must be resolvable. If it is a remote ref (e.g.
   `origin/main`), first run `git fetch REMOTE BRANCH`, so the delivery branch
   starts from the current remote state.
3. If the current HEAD has relevant uncommitted changes or local commits that
   are not contained in `delivery.baseBranch`, point that out. A delivery branch freshly
   created from the base branch does not contain this work. Only continue
   if the user confirms the chosen mode or the workflow creates a safe
   partial-diff PR by the procedure described below.
4. Construct delivery branch names: `<delivery.branchPrefix>/<skill>/<slug>`, e.g.
   `firmo/build/user-login`. Derive the slug from the plan title, the task description,
   the issue or finding. If the branch name already exists, append a
   numeric suffix and report the chosen name.

### Worktree execution

When worktree execution is active:

1. Determine the repo name from `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and use
   `worktree.baseDir` (default `.effective-flow/.worktrees`) as the base dir. Worktree path:
   `BASE_DIR/REPO_NAME/SESSION_ID`.
2. Create the worktree and delivery branch:
   `git worktree add <WORKTREE_PATH> -b <BRANCH_NAME> <BASE_REF>`.
3. Run setup per `worktree.setup` in the worktree and briefly announce the
   mode beforehand:
   - `auto` or missing: decide by lockfile – `pnpm-lock.yaml` →
     `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`, `package-lock.json` →
     `npm ci`, `yarn.lock` → `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, `Cargo.toml` →
     `cargo fetch --locked`, `go.mod` → `go mod download`, `uv.lock` →
     `uv sync --frozen`, `poetry.lock` → `poetry install --sync`, no known
     file → no setup.
   - `none`: run no setup.
   - String value: run this explicit command in the worktree.
4. Run all subsequent phases that create or change code, test or documentation
   files with the working directory in the worktree. This also applies to the
   completion phase up to and including the final validator/formatter.

### In-place delivery without worktree

When delivery is active and worktree execution stays off:

1. Remember the originally checked-out branch.
2. Ensure the working tree contains no uncommitted changes that
   should not become part of the delivery branch. If such changes exist,
   do not silently stage, stash or overwrite them; either obtain a user decision
   or use the partial-diff PR via worktree.
3. Create and check out the delivery branch from `delivery.baseBranch`.
4. Run implementation, tests, validation and final formatting on this delivery branch.
5. After completion, proceed per "Handback and completion action".

### Partial-diff PR via worktree

When the main checkout already holds changes that should not fully go into the PR,
a separate worktree is the preferred safe path, provided these
preconditions are met:

1. `git worktree` is available.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` is resolvable and, for remote refs, updatable.
3. The workflow knows an explicit list of the files that should go into the PR.

The procedure:

1. Create a fresh worktree branch from `delivery.baseBranch`.
2. Take only the selected delivery files from the main checkout into the worktree.
   Permitted sources for this selection are plan affected files,
   review finding scope, issue scope, known files produced by the workflow, or
   an explicit user selection.
3. In the worktree, check whether the taken-over files produce a meaningful diff
   against the base ref. If not, abort and create no empty PR.
4. Commit in the worktree and run `$effective-flow pr` against `delivery.baseBranch`.
5. Remove the worktree, leave the delivery branch locally and leave the main checkout
   unchanged. Non-selected changes in the main checkout remain untouched.

A heuristic partial-diff selection by "all changed files
except <plan.dir>" is not allowed. The workflow must know the files to include or
ask. This reliably keeps newly created plans, `.effective-flow/` state and other
local working files outside the PR.

### What lives in the delivery branch and what stays in the main repo

Data-keeping invariant: **Of the Effective Flow artifacts, only plans are
committed.** Reviews (local reports) and investigations always stay local and
untracked; in remote mode reviews are tracked as issues instead (never in the repo),
investigations remain purely local in any case (see "Issue-tracker integration" and
`$effective-flow investigate`).

- **In the delivery branch:** the actual code, test and documentation deliverables of the
  workflow as well as – if the workflow kept a plan file – its final
  state (in the implemented case the archived, implemented-marked plan file).
- **Only in the main repo, never committed:** pure Effective Flow bookkeeping and runtime state, i.e.
  all remaining `.effective-flow/` artifacts – `memory.json`, `cache.json`, local review reports
  under `.effective-flow/review/`, investigation reports under `.effective-flow/investigation/`,
  config migration status and wisdom files.

### Handback and completion action (completion phase)

Following the workflow's regular completion logic (including goal verification).
The final status switch of the plan file to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` and its
archiving is handled by step 1 below at the delivery point – the implementing workflow therefore does **not** set the
status beforehand, but leaves it to this phase (exception: in-place without
delivery, see step 1):

**Update existing PRs:** If the delivery branch already has a pull request
and subsequent changes are needed, those changes are always created and pushed as new
commits on the same PR branch. Existing PR commits must not
be rewritten via `commit --amend`, interactive rebase, squash or force-push.
If a normal push fails because of diverged remote history,
stop and report the conflict instead of overwriting history.

1. **Mark the plan as implemented, archive it and take it into the delivery branch:**
   Provided the workflow kept a plan file, this is the **delivery point** at which
   the plan counts as implemented (immediately before the PR is opened or the delivery branch
   is merged):
   - Set the canonical status marker to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` (preserve marker
     language: German marker → `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt`, English →
     `**Plan status:** Implemented`).
   - Move the plan file via `git mv` to `<plan.dir>/archive/` (create the directory if
     needed), per "Archive of implemented plans" of the plan-file convention.
   - If the implementation ran in a worktree or partial-diff worktree, provide this final,
     archived and implemented-marked state in the worktree (under
     `<plan.dir>/archive/<file>`). Marking and move are **committed along with it** and
     are thereby part of the PR/merge (implementation documentation). The `.effective-flow/` artifacts stay in the
     main repo.
   - If the workflow kept no plan file, this step does not apply.
   - If the workflow exceptionally runs in-place without delivery (no worktree, no
     branch/PR/merge action), the workflow performs the same status switch and
     archive move directly in the working tree; the final commit/merge into the
     target branch is then the delivery event.
2. **Ensure commit:** Commit all intended changes in the delivery branch
   – code, test and documentation deliverables as well as the taken-over plan file – via the
   commit logic from `$effective-flow commit` (stage exclusively known changed files
   explicitly, derive a concrete Conventional Commit message, never set a
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer). Workflows that have already committed their work
   (e.g. `$effective-flow maintain` with one commit per group) only commit the
   plan file here afterwards, if needed. If there is nothing to commit: inform the user,
   remove an automatically created empty delivery branch and end without
   PR/merge.
3. **Determine completion action:** If `delivery.completion` has a valid value,
   use it and briefly report that the action was taken from the Effective Flow configuration
   (project setup ADR). Otherwise ask:

Wenn Delivery was active and no valid value for `delivery.completion` is set: Frage den User: **How should the delivery branch be completed?**
- Pull request -- Push the branch and create a PR against the base branch via pr
- Merge -- Merge the branch locally into the base branch, without a PR
- Branch only -- Leave the branch in the local repo, no further action

4. **Withdraw worktree:** If a worktree was involved, run `git worktree remove
<WORKTREE_PATH>`; the delivery branch is retained in the local repo.
   If removal fails because of uncommitted remnants: first ensure that
   everything intended is committed; if something remains, keep the worktree and
   report the path.
5. **Execute action:**
   - `branch` / Branch only: leave the branch, report the name and a note about later
     PR creation.
   - `merge`: the target is the local branch part of `delivery.baseBranch` or the
     explicit `delivery.returnBranch`. Ensure that the target working tree
     is clean; otherwise inform instead of merging. If the local target branch is
     behind its remote-tracking ref, point that out. Merge the delivery branch –
     prefer fast-forward, otherwise a merge commit; on conflict stop, leave the branch
     and inform the user, no automatic conflict resolution.
   - `pr`: delegate to `$effective-flow pr` and pass the delivery branch, base branch and the
     workflow/change type (`feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`docs`/`chore` depending on the implementing
     workflow and effect) as a title-type hint, so the PR title carries a
     valid Conventional Commit type — with a squash merge it is the release signal.
6. **Restore checkout:** After successful PR creation or with `branch`, switch back to
   `delivery.returnBranch` or, with `auto`, to the local branch part of
   `delivery.baseBranch`, provided the working tree is clean. If the
   switch-back fails, explicitly report the actual branch as a side effect.

## PR review comment integration

This shared building block connects `$effective-flow iterate` with the review comments of an
existing pull request (GitHub via `gh`, Forgejo via `tea`). It encapsulates the
**PR-specific plumbing** that `issue-tracker.md` deliberately does not contain: PR resolution,
reading review threads, replying to a thread, resolving a thread, and posting a PR summary
comment.

Boundary to `issue-tracker.md`: that building block is tailored to **issues** and the
`tracker.mode` switch. PR review threads are a different API object.
`$effective-flow iterate` is – like ``tools/apply-issues.md``/`$effective-flow plan-issue` – **inherently
remote** in PR mode and does not evaluate `tracker.mode`; it merely needs a
Git repository, an `origin` remote, and an authenticated CLI. The **host and
CLI detection** is taken from `issue-tracker.md` (not reinvented); this building block
only adds the PR operations.

### No AI attribution

Do not add AI attribution to thread replies or the summary comment: no „Generated
with Claude Code/Codex" footers, no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`),
and no `Co-Authored-By` trailers – not even when the harness appends them as a default.
Reply texts in natural language according to the language rules.

### Host and CLI detection

Determine the tool analogously to `$effective-flow pr` and to "Host and CLI detection" in
`issue-tracker.md`:

1. **Precondition:** There is a Git repository with an `origin` remote present. If
   `origin` is missing or it is not a Git repository, PR mode is not possible: report clearly.
2. **Choose the tool:** Read the `origin` URL (`git remote get-url origin`) and extract the
   host robustly for HTTPS and SSH forms. If the host is exactly `github.com`, the tool is
   `gh`; for any other host, Forgejo/Gitea is assumed and `tea` is used. An
   explicit per-run hint from the user takes precedence for an ambiguous host (e.g. GitHub
   Enterprise); if the host is ambiguous and neither a hint nor an override is present,
   ask the user.
3. **Check availability:** Make sure the chosen CLI is installed and
   authenticated (`gh auth status` or `tea` with a configured login). If the CLI
   or the authentication is missing: emit a clear error message with a remediation hint and abort
   without side effect. Do **not** silently fall back to local work; a local
   fallback only after explicit user consent.

### PR resolution

Resolve the target PR from the argument or the current branch and determine the PR number,
head branch, base branch, URL, and state:

- **From argument:** a PR reference is a bare number (`42`), `#42`, or a PR URL. A
  PR URL carries the segment `/pull/` (GitHub) or `/pulls/` (Forgejo) – this distinguishes it
  from an issue URL (`/issues/`).
- **From the current branch:** if no PR reference was passed, try to determine the open PR of the
  currently checked-out branch.

| Operation              | GitHub (`gh`)                                                                       | Forgejo (`tea`)                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read PR from number    | `gh pr view <nr> --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,url,state,isCrossRepository` | `tea pr <nr>` or Forgejo API `GET /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>` |
| PR from current branch | `gh pr view --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,url,state`                        | `tea pr list --state open` and filter by the head branch            |

If the PR is already `merged`/`closed`: report and push no commits (see error cases in
`$effective-flow iterate`).

### Read review threads (always fresh)

Read the review comments **directly before** classification fresh from the host – comments
can change between runs. Capture per thread: thread ID, author (and whether bot or
human), file + line, comment text, and the `resolved` status.

| Operation                   | GitHub (`gh`)                                                               | Forgejo (`tea`)                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read inline review comments | `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>/comments`                           | Forgejo API `GET /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>/reviews` or `.../comments`                      |
| Read thread/resolved status | GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads` (fields `id`, `isResolved`, `comments`) | best-effort via the Forgejo API; if the resolved status is not available, treat all as unresolved |
| Read PR-level comments      | `gh pr view <nr> --json comments`                                           | `tea pr <nr> --comments`, otherwise Forgejo API                                                   |

For the GraphQL query, determine `owner`/`repo` from the `origin` URL. For Forgejo, check the
exact flag/endpoint names against the installed `tea` version if a call
fails (as noted in `$effective-flow pr`).

### Reply to a thread

| Operation                 | GitHub (`gh`)                                                                    | Forgejo (`tea`)                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reply to a review comment | `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>/comments/<comment-id>/replies -f body=…` | Forgejo API `POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<nr>/reviews` referencing the comment |

Every reply carries the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` (see idempotency).

### Resolve a thread

| Operation             | GitHub (`gh`)                                               | Forgejo (`tea`)                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resolve review thread | GraphQL mutation `resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId })` | best-effort; if the installed API/`tea` version does not support resolving, **only reply** and note in the summary that manual resolution is needed – **no abort** |

### Post summary comment

| Operation       | GitHub (`gh`)                 | Forgejo (`tea`)                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Post PR comment | `gh pr comment <nr> --body …` | `tea comment <nr> …`, otherwise Forgejo API |

Per run, **exactly one** summary comment with the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` is
posted: which points were implemented, which skipped, and which pure questions are listed as
open/deferred.

### Idempotency via the Effective Flow marker

Replies and the summary comment carry the HTML marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`. Read
the existing PR and review comments **fresh before every write**: a thread that is
already `resolved` or carries an `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` reply is considered done and
is not processed again. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present old marker
`<!-- firmo-iterate -->` from an earlier run is recognized as equivalent on read (no
double processing of in-flight threads); newly written is exclusively
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`. This keeps a second `$effective-flow iterate` run on the same PR
clean.

### No history rewriting

New work goes exclusively as **new commits** onto the PR head branch and is pushed normally –
consistent with `$effective-flow pr` and "Updating existing PRs" in the delivery
and worktree integration. No `commit --amend`, no rebase, no squash, no force-push.
If the push is rejected because of diverged remote history, stop and report the conflict
instead of overwriting history.

## Wisdom Accumulation

At the start, generate a session ID (e.g. via timestamp) and use
`.effective-flow/.wisdom-accumulation-<SESSION_ID>.tmp.md` for:

- the resolved PR (number, head/base branch, URL) or the local target diff
- the review threads read, with author, file/line, and resolved status
- the classification per item (actionable/not actionable, action type, already addressed)
- implemented items, commits created, threads replied to/resolved
- deferred pure questions and failed items

Write a summary after each phase and pass it on to later phases. Delete the file at the
end.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Target detection and input parsing

1. Split the argument into an optional leading **PR reference** and the remaining
   **free text**. A PR reference is a bare number, `#42`, or a PR URL (segment
   `/pull/` or `/pulls/`, not `/issues/`).
2. Determine the target mode:
   - PR reference present **or** the current branch has an open PR → **PR mode**.
   - otherwise → **Local mode**.
3. On ambiguity (e.g. a bare number that could also be an issue) ask,
   instead of guessing.
4. `iterate` always continues an **existing** change; there is no full intent gate as
   in $effective-flow build.

### Phase 1: Gather context

- **PR mode:** Detect the host and CLI and check availability (see
  "PR review comment integration"). Resolve the PR and read the review threads **fresh**.
  Take the free-text instructions in as additional items. Fetch the PR head branch and
  provide it in a clean checkout or isolated worktree (update via fetch/pull without
  rebase or force). If the PR is already merged/closed, report that and optionally offer
  local mode.
- **Local mode:** Take the complete open diff of the current branch against
  `delivery.baseBranch` (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) as context. The source of the items to
  implement is only the free text.

### Phase 2: Classification

Determine per item (review thread or free-text instruction):

1. **actionable vs. not actionable:**
   - pure praise/info comments do not count as actionable.
   - **Nitpick and low-priority bot comments are taken along as actionable by
     default** – the approval gate in phase 2.5 lets the user deselect individual ones.
   - **pure questions** without a need for code changes are not implemented and are **not
     automatically answered in substance**; they are listed in the summary as open/deferred
     so the user answers them themselves.
2. **already addressed:** thread is `resolved` or carries a `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`
   reply → skip.
3. Derive the **action type**:
   - $effective-flow fix for a bug/correction,
   - $effective-flow refactor for structure without behavior change,
   - $effective-flow build for small new functionality,
   - $effective-flow docs for pure documentation.
     Treat human and bot comments equally.
4. Create a task per actionable item (per-item granularity).

### Phase 2.5: Approval

Show the classified items (actionable, skipped, deferred questions) and obtain an
approval. Without approval **no** externally visible action takes place (no push, no
comment). Handle the response per "Explicit goal query for autonomous runs": on "Autonomous
via /goal" emit the `/goal` string for phases 3–6. The query is omitted if `iterate`
was delegated non-interactively (e.g. by $effective-flow apply-review).

Frage den User: **Approve and implement the classified items?**
- Yes -- Approval granted, implementation and delivery-back continue gated
- Autonomous via /goal -- Remaining phases autonomously under native /goal — the skill emits the /goal string to paste (omitted for non-interactive delegation)
- Adjust -- Enter feedback as free text, e.g. deselect individual items

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Delegate each actionable item to the appropriate skill ($effective-flow fix, $effective-flow refactor,
   $effective-flow build, or $effective-flow docs), on the PR head branch (PR mode) or the current
   branch (local mode).
2. **One commit per thread/item** with a clean conventional-commit message without internal
   IDs or a thread reference and without `Co-Authored-By`. File-overlapping items run
   sequentially so the commits stay ordered; independent items may be implemented in
   parallel.
3. Give internal delegation sub-agents the completion protocol and check for `DONE` or
   `ABORT`. On `ABORT`: mark the item as failed and continue with the next.

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Start `code-validator` or the project-wide quality gate.
2. Fix errors found and verify again per "Goal-driven completion control":
   limit the internal correction rounds and escalate to the user if the checks still fail
   afterwards.

### Phase 5: Delivery back (PR mode only)

1. Push the head branch normally (no force). If the push fails due to diverged remote history:
   stop, report the conflict, overwrite no history, and resolve no threads.
2. Reply briefly per addressed thread and resolve it (GitHub via GraphQL; Forgejo
   best-effort). Use the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`.
3. Post **one** summary comment on the PR (marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`): which items
   were implemented or skipped and which pure questions are open/deferred (without a
   substantive auto-reply).

### Phase 6: Summary

1. Delete the wisdom file.
2. Give the user a summary:
   - table: implemented / skipped / deferred questions / failed
   - PR URL, pushed commits, resolved threads, final checkout state
   - in local mode: which commits were created on which branch

## Rules

## Pre-commit gate

Before every commit, the checks configured in the project must pass without errors. Typical checks are type-checking, linting, and tests — use the scripts defined in the project (e.g. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm agent:check`).

- If a check reports errors: fix the errors first, then check again.
- Never commit code that does not pass these checks.
- This rule applies even when a separate verification phase exists — it is an additional safeguard, not a replacement.

## Commit message rules

- **Never set `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commit messages**, regardless of whether an LLM (Claude, Codex, GPT, …) or another tool suggests the line or inserts it as a default.
- If a `Co-Authored-By` line is already present in a commit template, `commit.template`, a `--trailer` invocation, or a draft message: remove it before committing.
- **Do not add AI attribution:** no „Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers and no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) in commit messages – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex remain allowed, generation attribution does not.
- Avoid generic messages like `update files` or `misc changes`.
- Describe concretely what was changed and why.
- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Choose the commit type by **effect**, not by file type: behavior-changing changes – including pure **config/env/secrets/CI** with deployment or runtime effect (e.g. corrected values in env/secret artifacts that take effect remotely via sync) – are `fix:` (or `feat:` for new functionality). `chore:` only for **deploy-neutral** changes without behavioral effect (pure maintenance, formatting, tooling without runtime effect). This also applies to the **squash PR title**, which determines the release-please bump on a squash merge.
- Do not expose internal tracking IDs in commit messages, e.g. review finding IDs like `R-0000001`, local plan/review IDs like `F1`, or placeholders like `[Finding-ID]`. Such IDs belong in wisdom/report context, not in the Git history.

- Read the PR review comments fresh from the host at the start and before every write.
- Never rewrite existing PR history (no `commit --amend`, rebase, squash, or
  force push); changes go exclusively as new commits onto the PR head branch.
- In PR mode, create no new delivery branch and no new PR.
- Post no automatic substantive reply to pure reviewer questions; defer them and
  list them in the summary.
- Never set a `Co-Authored-By` trailer and add no AI attribution in commits,
  thread replies, the summary comment, or the PR body.
- Give the user a brief status update after each phase.
- On a missing or unauthenticated CLI: abort cleanly, do not secretly push a local
  implementation.
