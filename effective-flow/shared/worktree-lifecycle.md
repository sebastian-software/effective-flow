## Effective Flow-owned worktree lifecycle

This contract adds crash-tolerant lifecycle evidence to the execution-location receipt. It never
replaces that receipt, Git's worktree registration, or the runtime-state write-safety contract.
A configured base directory, path pattern, branch prefix, age, or apparently empty checkout is
not ownership evidence.

Only worktrees created by Effective Flow receive lifecycle records. Reused user-managed or
`harness-managed` worktrees remain outside this lifecycle and must never be adopted retroactively.

### Runtime record

Each Effective Flow-created worktree is described by one file
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/worktree-runs/<RECORD_ID>.json`, and while a writer holds
it, by the per-record lock `<RECORD_ID>.lock` beside it. Only the runtime-state helper operations below
create, change, claim or delete a record or take its lock; never write, rename or delete either in
prose. The helper resolves `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` from `cwd` and applies “Runtime-state write safety”
to every record and lock handle itself, fail-closed. `RECORD_ID` is an opaque, collision-resistant identifier matching
`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,79}$`, generated once and never derived from the path or branch. A
version 1 record has exactly this key set; strings are illustrative:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "recordId": "opaque-record-id",
  "sessionId": "workflow-session-id",
  "componentId": null,
  "workflow": "build",
  "purpose": "delivery",
  "repositoryIdentity": "/canonical/common-git-dir",
  "runtimeStateRoot": "/canonical/main-worktree",
  "worktreePath": "/canonical/linked-worktree",
  "branch": "effective-flow/build/example",
  "creationOid": "full-commit-oid",
  "ownership": "effective-flow-created",
  "receipt": {
    "repositoryIdentity": "/canonical/common-git-dir",
    "executionRoot": "/canonical/linked-worktree",
    "runtimeStateRoot": "/canonical/main-worktree",
    "checkout": {
      "kind": "branch",
      "branch": "effective-flow/build/example"
    },
    "origin": "effective-flow-created",
    "setupOwner": "Effective Flow build",
    "setupStatus": "pending",
    "workflow": "build",
    "purpose": "delivery"
  },
  "branchPolicy": "retain",
  "createdAt": "RFC-3339 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "RFC-3339 timestamp",
  "status": "active",
  "reason": null
}
```

`componentId` is the component identifier or `null`. `purpose` and `branchPolicy` are bound
together: `delivery` and `partial-diff` at exactly `BASE_DIR/REPO_NAME/SESSION_ID` and
`plan-publication` at `BASE_DIR/REPO_NAME/SESSION_ID-plan-publication` carry `retain`;
`apply-review` at a direct child of its session directory, on branch
`apply-review/<SESSION_ID>/<GROUP_NAME>`, carries `delete-after-integration`. `reason` is `null` for
`active` and `cleanup-ready` and the exact reason otherwise. `creationOid` is the full commit OID at
which worktree and branch creation succeeded, captured once and never replaced. The `receipt` is the
immutable creation snapshot; fresh receipts are compared with it, never written into it. During
`cleanup-in-progress` a cleanup claim, `cleanupRunId` and `claimedAt`, names its owner and
timestamp. The helper refuses an unknown schema, a missing or extra key or an invalid value and never
repairs, rewrites or deletes such a record.

### State machine

- `active`: the worktree exists and its owning workflow may still use it
- `cleanup-ready`: the intended work is durably secured on or integrated from the branch and the
  owner has released the worktree for safe removal
- `aborted`: the workflow stopped in a controlled way before cleanup readiness
- `failed`: the workflow failed or cannot prove that its intended work was safely completed
- `cleanup-in-progress`: one actor owns an exclusive removal claim
- `cleanup-failed`: an ordinary removal or required post-removal operation failed and may be
  retried only after all eligibility proofs pass again

| From                                | To or terminal action                   | Operation                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| newly created                       | `active`                                | `worktree record-init`                                                   |
| `active`                            | `cleanup-ready`, `aborted`, or `failed` | `worktree transition` by the owning session                              |
| `aborted` or `failed`               | `active` (adoption)                     | `worktree transition` under the record lock, `plan-pr-continuation` only |
| `cleanup-ready` or `cleanup-failed` | `cleanup-in-progress`                   | claim inside `worktree remove`, `cleanup apply`                          |
| `cleanup-in-progress`               | `cleanup-failed` or record deleted      | the claiming helper call reconciles                                      |

A controlled user or workflow stop becomes `aborted`; an implementation, integration, validation,
ownership, or state-persistence error becomes `failed`. A sudden interruption leaves `active`,
`cleanup-in-progress`, or a lock in place: report that uncertainty, and never infer a crash or
completion from elapsed time. There is no TTL, heartbeat, stale-after threshold or age-based
transition. A foreign, ownerless or interrupted lock or claim stays: never break or take it over.

### Removal eligibility

The helper evaluates these conditions from fresh evidence under the record lock and reports every
failed one by number (`NOT_ELIGIBLE`, `conditions`):

1. The record is schema-valid, `effective-flow-created`, and `cleanup-ready` or `cleanup-failed`
   (`worktree remove` also accepts this session's `active` record).
2. Repository identity, `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, path, branch, workflow, purpose and receipt snapshot
   match fresh evidence.
3. Exactly one linked worktree in `git worktree list --porcelain -z` matches the path.
4. That worktree is neither `locked` nor `prunable`, its directory exists, and its common Git
   directory matches.
5. Its `HEAD` and registration name the recorded branch; detached or changed branch identities fail.
6. `creationOid` is a commit and an ancestor of the branch tip
   (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <CREATION_OID> <CURRENT_BRANCH_TIP>` exits `0`), never compared
   with a moving remote tip.
7. `git -C <WORKTREE_PATH> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignore-submodules=none` is
   empty.
8. It is neither the main worktree nor the calling run's own execution worktree.
9. No foreign or ownerless lock or cleanup claim exists.

### Helper operations

**Helper call shape.** Write every call of the three JSON helpers as exactly one simple command:

```text
node <skill-root>/scripts/<helper>.mjs <argv> <<< '<json>'
```

with exactly this `<argv>` per helper: `effective-flow-state.mjs <group> <operation>`,
`config-resolve.mjs resolve`, and `remote-tracker.mjs <operation>`, or `<operation> --apply` for a
mutation.

- Resolve `<skill-root>` from the currently loaded Effective Flow skill, in the form it was
  reached (a symlinked install path included, never resolved through `realpath`), and spell it out
  literally as an absolute path. Never use a shell variable, `$PWD`, `~`, command substitution,
  `cd … &&`, an `echo … |` or `printf … |` pipe, a heredoc, a loop or function, a compound
  command joined by `;`, `&&` or `||`, a trailing `echo "exit=$?"` or any other trailing command,
  or `| grep` or any other pipe on the output. Read the exit status and the envelope from the tool
  result itself.
- Every JSON value is literal too: `cwd`, where sent, is the literal absolute path its owning
  contract names (`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` for `effective-flow-state.mjs`), never `$PWD`. Write a `'`
  inside the JSON as `'\''`.
- The Claude Code allow rule matches only this literal shape, so any other shape prompts for
  permission on every call. The rule binds every harness, since it is also the auditable shape.

`cwd` is `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`; `executionRoot` is the registered checkout the calling run operates
from, and `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` for `worktree inspect`, the exit self-check and every call after the
run's own worktree was withdrawn, since that path no longer exists. `sessionId` proves ownership:
the record's own, or on adoption the new owner (`build` passes its build-run ID).

```text
node <skill-root>/scripts/effective-flow-state.mjs worktree record-init <<< '{"cwd":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","executionRoot":"<EXECUTION_ROOT>","record":<complete version 1 record, status active>}'
node <skill-root>/scripts/effective-flow-state.mjs worktree transition <<< '{"cwd":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","executionRoot":"<EXECUTION_ROOT>","recordId":"<RECORD_ID>","from":"active","to":"<cleanup-ready|aborted|failed>","reason":<null or "<reason>">,"sessionId":"<SESSION_ID>"}'
node <skill-root>/scripts/effective-flow-state.mjs worktree inspect <<< '{"cwd":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","executionRoot":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","sessionId":"<SESSION_ID>"}'
node <skill-root>/scripts/effective-flow-state.mjs worktree remove <<< '{"cwd":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","executionRoot":"<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>","sessionId":"<SESSION_ID>","recordIds":["<RECORD_ID>"]}'
```

- **`worktree record-init`** runs immediately after the verified `effective-flow-created` receipt
  and before setup or delegation. It writes the record no-clobber only for a newly registered,
  unlocked linked worktree at the purpose's path whose branch tip is `creationOid`.
- **`worktree transition`** runs under the record lock; a `from` that differs from the stored
  status writes nothing.
- **`worktree inspect`** is read-only: the session's records with their failed conditions, plus
  registered worktrees under its session paths that no record names (`unrecorded`). Omitting
  `sessionId` covers every session.
- **`worktree remove`** lists every record of one session to withdraw in one call. Under one lock
  hold per record it moves `active` to `cleanup-ready`, claims it, runs only
  `git worktree remove <WORKTREE_PATH>` without force and never `git worktree prune`, applies the
  branch policy and deletes the record; a failed removal persists `cleanup-failed` with Git's error,
  and an already absent worktree is reconciled only under the call's own claim. Give the call an
  explicit Bash timeout of 120000 ms, above its 90 s deadline; in Codex, request sandbox escalation
  for it up front. `executionRoot` is never one of the listed worktrees.

**Branch policy.** `retain` leaves the branch. `delete-after-integration` runs
`git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`; when Git refuses, only an `apply-review` call carrying
`integrationRoot` lets the helper prove every component commit by exact patch-id against the branch
checked out there and then compare-and-delete the ref. Prose never runs `git branch -D`, and a
forced deletion outside that proof never happens.

**Outcomes.** Exit 0 carries `result`, exit 4 an `outcome.code`; any other exit, an unparsable
envelope or an `error` is handled as not `ok`. `worktree remove` exits 0 with `result.items[]`, one
`{recordId, ok, code?}` per record.

**Denial fallback.** After `worktree remove` returns any item that is not `ok` (`BRANCH_RETAINED`
aside) or fails as a whole call, and after the one `SANDBOX_DENIED` rerun, call `worktree
transition` `active` → `cleanup-ready` with `"reason":null` for every listed record not reported
removed (`STATUS_MISMATCH` means it already left `active`), because `effective-flow cleanup` collects only
`cleanup-ready` and `cleanup-failed`; report each retained worktree for `effective-flow cleanup`.

A final report names every retained worktree and every `BRANCH_RETAINED` branch, because no record
points at that branch any more.
