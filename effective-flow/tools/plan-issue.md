# Effective Flow Plan Issues

You are the orchestrator that makes incompletely specified issues implementable through interactive clarification.

## Goal

``tools/apply-issues.md`` skips issues whose information is insufficient for autonomous
implementation and marks them with `effective-flow-needs-planning`. This skill plans each selected
issue independently using the clarification, gap-analysis, validation, and internal-review
baseline of `effective-flow plan`. It persists that baseline and an optional deep interactive review in
one marked issue comment, and removes `effective-flow-needs-planning` only when no
implementation-blocking open point remains.

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project-setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default `docs/plan`).

Hard scope boundary:

- This skill **generates no code** and starts no implementation, test, validator, or code-review
  phase. It may run only the planning judgments and internal deep plan review defined below.
- It creates **no** `<plan.dir>/` file; the issue remains the only source. All results end up as an issue comment.
- It does not implement the issue itself — the implementation is subsequently handled by ``tools/apply-issues.md``.
- Remote writes are limited to creating the first canonical planning comment, updating that exact
  comment by its tracker ID, and changing the issue's planning-readiness labels. A failed or
  unsupported update must stop before any replacement comment is created.

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/runtime-state-safety.md`, when a remote tracker access is about to write its local migration marker.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/effective-flow-dir-migration.md`, when a remote tracker access is about to perform its first runtime-state mutation.

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to effective-flow setup. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers (effective-flow setup, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, effective-flow setup may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, effective-flow setup may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:start -->

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in effective-flow setup.

Outside effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to effective-flow setup.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:end -->

## Project conventions

If the project contains an `AGENTS.md`, read it early in the workflow and observe its specifications for planning and user follow-up questions.

## Recommended skills

- `codebase-improvement`

## Tracker integration

This skill is **inherently remote** and always works against the issue tracker of the `origin` remote; the `tracker.mode` switch is **not** evaluated. From the following building block it uses the provider-neutral remote helper, its probe/dry-run/apply envelope, and its structured error cases.

## Issue-tracker integration (remote mode)

This shared fragment connects `effective-flow review` and ``tools/apply-review.md`` with an external issue tracker (GitHub via `gh`, Forgejo via `tea`). It is **opt-in** via the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) and disabled by default (`local`). In local mode both skills behave unchanged – findings run through the Markdown report file under `.effective-flow/review/`, no issues are created and no CLI is invoked.

The local/remote toggle (`tracker.mode`) affects exclusively **reviews**. **Investigations** (`effective-flow investigate`) are exempt from it and remain purely local in every mode under `.effective-flow/investigation/` (never committed, never as an issue). Of the Effective Flow artifacts, only **plans** are committed.

It encapsulates the **shared** building blocks: the `tracker` config schema including migration, the mode determination, the provider-neutral remote-helper contract, the label convention, and the canonical issue and epic body formats. The actual orchestration – when issues are **created** (`effective-flow review`) and when they are **read and processed** (``tools/apply-review.md``) – stays in the respective skill.

In addition, ``tools/apply-issues.md`` and `effective-flow plan-issue` use this fragment for the same provider-neutral helper operations. These two skills process **arbitrary** human issues instead of the finding issues produced by `effective-flow review`; they are **inherently remote** and do **not** evaluate the `tracker.mode` toggle (local/remote) – they only need a Git repository, an `origin` remote and an authenticated CLI. The finding-/epic-specific sections (issue body format, epic body format, `R-XXXXXXX` convention) apply only to `effective-flow review`/``tools/apply-review.md``; the checkbox-ticking mechanics for epic bodies are used by ``tools/apply-issues.md`` analogously for container issues.

### Configuration

Remote mode works without pinned configuration (then it stays disabled, `local`). If the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) pins corresponding values, they override these defaults (schema shown here for illustration):

```json
{
  "tracker": {
    "mode": "local",
    "remoteToolOverride": "auto"
  }
}
```

Missing values have these defaults:

- `tracker.mode`: `"local"` (feature off)
- `tracker.remoteToolOverride`: `"auto"` (tool automatically from the `origin` URL)

Valid values:

- `tracker.mode`: `"local"`, `"remote"`
- `tracker.remoteToolOverride`: `"auto"`, `"github"`, `"forgejo"`

`remoteToolOverride` is intended only for ambiguous hosts (e.g. self-hosted GitHub Enterprise whose domain does not contain `github.com`). With `auto` the host detection below decides.

### Config migration

Reading the Effective Flow configuration from the project setup ADR (including the `tracker` keys) and the one-time migration of a legacy config is handled centrally by the fragment "Config migration" (`config-migration.md`); this fragment performs no own per-block migration for `tracker` anymore. The `tracker` config schema above (configuration, valid values, mode determination, first-invocation query) remains unaffected by this.

### Determine mode

At the start of the run, determine the effective mode in this order (the first matching rule wins):

1. **Argument type:** The passed argument type overrides the config mode for this run. A report file (`*.md` under `.effective-flow/review/`) forces `local`; an issue reference (issue number, `#123` or an issue URL) forces `remote`.
2. **Per-run wish of the user:** If the user explicitly requests issue/tracker work, `remote` is active; if they explicitly request local work ("local", "without issues", "report only"), `local` is active.
3. **Config:** otherwise `tracker.mode` from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) applies.
4. **First-invocation query:** If `tracker.mode` is not set in the config and neither argument nor per-run wish delivers a signal, run the first-invocation query below.

### First-invocation query

Only when step 4 above applies (no config value, no argument/per-run signal):

Ask the user: **Should review findings be tracked locally as a Markdown report or remotely as issues (GitHub/Forgejo)?**
- Local -- tracker.mode = local — Markdown report under .effective-flow/review/ (previous behavior)
- Remote -- tracker.mode = remote — findings as issues, tool automatically from origin (gh/tea)

Use the chosen answer as the tracker mode **for this run**. Do **not** write it into the configuration yourself — permanently pinning `tracker.mode` in the project setup ADR is handled exclusively by `effective-flow setup`. Briefly point this out to the user, e.g. "Tracker mode `remote` used for this run; pin permanently via `effective-flow setup`."

### Remote helper contract (remote mode only)

All deterministic remote mechanics run through the shipped helper:

```text
node <skill-root>/scripts/remote-tracker.mjs <operation> [--apply]
```

Pass exactly one JSON object through standard input and parse exactly one JSON result envelope from standard output. Resolve `<skill-root>` from the currently loaded Effective Flow skill; never copy the helper into the target project. The helper owns origin/provider/reference parsing, `gh`/`tea` probing, capability normalization, command construction, JSON normalization, payload validation, compatibility aliases, exact body patching, redaction, and stale-write preconditions. It never opens a shell and never prompts.

For `finding-build` and `epic-build`, pass the already-resolved `language.forge` as the top-level
`language: en|de`; this applies equally when the finding or epic data is nested under its named
key. The optional field defaults to `en`, and unsupported values are rejected. The helper returns
the same language-stable payload keys in either language.

Successful envelopes contain `ok`, `operation`, `provider`, `data`, and `dryRun`. Failed envelopes additionally contain `error.code`, `error.message`, redacted `error.details`, and `error.retryable`, and the process exits nonzero. Treat errors as workflow input; do not discover flags, assemble API requests, read CLI credentials, or invent a fallback. In particular:

- `AMBIGUOUS_HOST`: obtain an explicit `github`/`forgejo` choice from configuration or the user, then retry with that override.
- `CLI_MISSING`/`AUTH_FAILED`: abort without side effects; offer local mode only with explicit user consent.
- `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`: report the unsupported provider capability and preserve the surrounding workflow state.
- `STALE_WRITE`: abort that write without retrying, merging, or overwriting; re-enter the workflow from a fresh read.
- all other structured errors: preserve scope and let the owning workflow decide whether a retry is safe.

Reads execute immediately. Mutations are dry runs by default: inspect the returned executable, argument vector, and redacted input preview, obtain every workflow-specific approval that still applies, and only then repeat the same operation with `--apply`. A dry run never changes Git, tracker state, memory, labels, issues, pull requests, comments, or review threads.

### Label convention

In remote mode, use these labels and create missing labels idempotently (tolerate an "already exists" message, do not treat it as an error):

| Label                                                                                          | Meaning                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `effective-flow-review-finding`                                                                | marks a single finding issue                                                      |
| `effective-flow-review-epic`                                                                   | marks the epic/tracking issue                                                     |
| `effective-flow-fix`, `effective-flow-refactor`, `effective-flow-build`, `effective-flow-docs` | target action of the finding (exactly one per finding issue)                      |
| `critical`, `important`, `note`                                                                | severity of the finding (exactly one per finding issue; `note` for note findings) |
| `wontfix`                                                                                      | deliberately do not implement finding → ADR instead of code                       |
| `effective-flow-issue-done`                                                                    | issue implemented by ``tools/apply-issues.md`` (PR created)                        |
| `effective-flow-needs-planning`                                                                | skipped by ``tools/apply-issues.md``; planning via `effective-flow plan-issue` needed   |

`wontfix` already exists on many trackers; create it only if it is missing. `effective-flow-issue-done` and `effective-flow-needs-planning` belong to the issue-driven flow (``tools/apply-issues.md``/`effective-flow plan-issue`) and are created idempotently there.

**Backward compatibility (severity labels):** The English severity labels `critical`/`important`/`note` are the default; newly created or set is exclusively the English label. The former German labels `kritisch`/`wichtig`/`hinweis` are **not** upgraded but stay **recognized** permanently when reading, listing, deduplicating and detecting a finding's severity — run a severity query per language variant (once `critical`/`important`/`note`, once `kritisch`/`wichtig`/`hinweis`) and union by issue number, analogous to the `firmo-`/`effective-flow-` prefix rule above.

**Backward compatibility (legacy prefix `firmo-`):** Earlier versions used the prefix `firmo-` instead of `effective-flow-` (`firmo-review-finding`, `firmo-review-epic`, `firmo-fix`/`firmo-refactor`/`firmo-build`/`firmo-docs`, `firmo-issue-done`, `firmo-needs-planning`). Newly **created or set** is exclusively the `effective-flow-` label; an upgrade of existing `firmo-` labels is **not** needed. When **reading, listing, deduplicating and detecting**, every `firmo-` variant counts permanently as equivalent to the associated `effective-flow-` variant:

- **Listing/filtering** (dedup, epic/issue search): `gh`/`tea` combine multiple `--label` specifications with AND semantics. Therefore run the query **separately per prefix** (once `effective-flow-…`, once `firmo-…`) and union the matches by the issue number.
- **Removing a status label** (`effective-flow-needs-planning`, `effective-flow-issue-done`): additionally remove the legacy `firmo-` variant, if present, so an issue does not stay "stuck" through a leftover legacy label.

**One-time `sf-` label migration:** The even older prefix `sf-` (`sf-review-finding`, `sf-review-epic`, `sf-fix`/`sf-refactor`/`sf-build`/`sf-docs`, `sf-issue-done`, `sf-needs-planning`) is **no longer** detected continuously, but **migrated once per repo**. On the **first** remote tracker access — provided the marker `labelMigration.sf.done` in the retained absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle is missing and an authenticated CLI is present — an idempotent migration moves every still-present `sf-<x>` label to `effective-flow-<x>`: first add `effective-flow-<x>` on the issue, then remove `sf-<x>` (not the other way around, so an abort leaves no issue unclassified). If the runtime directory is missing, apply the owning workflow's loaded “Runtime-state write safety” contract from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` to that exact directory immediately before its `mkdir`. After the remote migration, use the loaded shared memory mutation contract against the retained absolute memory handle: acquire its lock, re-read memory, merge only `labelMigration.sf`, and atomically persist `done` plus the completion timestamp while preserving every sibling and unknown field. If this marker mutation blocks or fails, preserve local state, report that the remote labels may already have migrated, and direct the user to `effective-flow setup`; the next run may repeat the idempotent remote migration. If the migration finds no `sf-` labels, it is a silent no-op. If the marker is set, any further scan is skipped — ongoing operations know only `effective-flow-` and `firmo-`. `sf-` is referenced exclusively in this migration.

### No AI attribution in issue bodies and comments

Do not add AI attribution to issue bodies, epic bodies and comments: no "Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers, no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) and no `Co-Authored-By` trailers – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex as the target harness are allowed, generation attribution is not.

### Remote prose language

Resolve `language.forge` once per remote run and pass it to all issue/comment writers. Preserve
the clear language of an existing issue or thread when editing/replying; otherwise use the
resolved Forge language. Finding and epic bodies use one complete language for human-readable
titles, headings, field labels, displayed severity/complexity values, and prose.

The German display mapping is `Schweregrad`, `Komplexität`, `Bereich`, `Datei`, `Problem`,
`Empfehlung`, `Prompt-Vorschlag`, `Befunde`, and
`Übersprungen (Architekturentscheidungen)`. English uses the template labels below. `Action`,
`Epic`, and `Signature` are stable helper/dedup fields and remain canonical English in both
forms, as do their action values. Displayed severities map to
`Kritisch`/`Wichtig`/`Hinweis`, and displayed complexities map to
`Niedrig`/`Mittel`/`Hoch`; their helper input enums remain
`Critical`/`Important`/`Note` and `Low`/`Medium`/`High`. Labels, issue numbers, `R-XXXXXXX` IDs, HTML markers, body
hashes, checklist syntax, and helper payload keys are never localized. Readers accept both
German and English historical display fields, including legacy `Signatur`, but canonical writes
use `Signature`.

### Issue body format (finding issue)

A finding issue must be **self-contained**: a foreign LLM session must be able to process it without access to the producing session. It contains the same content fields as a finding block of the local report format (see `effective-flow review`, "Report format").

- **Title:** `[R-XXXXXXX] <short title in language.forge>`
- **Labels:** `effective-flow-review-finding`, the action label and the severity label.
- **Body** (canonical template):

```markdown
- **Severity**: Critical / Important / Note
- **Complexity**: Low / Medium / High
- **Area**: [...]
- **File**: [path:line]
- **Problem**: [...]
- **Recommendation**: [...]
- **Action**: effective-flow-fix | effective-flow-refactor | effective-flow-build | effective-flow-docs
- **Prompt suggestion**: [directly copy-pasteable plain text, without enclosing quotation marks, without escape sequences]
- **Epic**: #<epic number> (empty if no epic)
- **Signature**: [path:line] · [Area] · [short summary of the problem]  <!-- Dedup key -->
```

The **Signature** field fixes the content dedup key (file+line, area, problem). It is deliberately **not** the `R-XXXXXXX` ID, because that is assigned freshly per run. Canonical writes use `Signature`; helper reads and deduplication also accept the legacy field name `Signatur` and normalize both forms to the same identity.

### Epic body format (tracking issue)

- **Title:** `Code review YYYY-MM-DD[-N]` for English or
  `Code-Review YYYY-MM-DD[-N]` for German
- **Labels:** `effective-flow-review-epic`
- **Body** (canonical template):

```markdown
Code review of YYYY-MM-DD · Scope: [Entire code / Described area] · Project type: [...]

## Findings

- [ ] #<nr> [R-0000001] <short title> — Action: effective-flow-fix
- [ ] #<nr> [R-0000002] <short title> — Action: effective-flow-refactor

## Skipped (design decisions)

- <short title> — Signature: [normalized signature] — covered by [decision reference] ([Source])
```

Rules for the task list:

- Each entry under `## Findings` references exactly one finding issue via its number and carries the `R-XXXXXXX` ID as well as the action.
- The section `## Skipped (design decisions)` uses **no** checkboxes and lists only findings filtered out by design decisions. A skipped entry is identified by title, normalized signature, and decision reference; it carries no issue number and no `R-XXXXXXX` ID, and it never advances `lastFindingNumber`. The section is omitted when no such findings are present.
- Ticking off delegates the exact checklist patch to the helper, using the body hash from the preceding fresh read. It may append the PR link; a finding deliberately not implemented is marked with its decision reference.

### Tracker operations

Describe tracker access only as a helper operation: issue/PR read and list, issue/PR create,
comment read/create/update, label create/change, PR review-thread read/reply/resolve,
marker/checklist patch, or PR creation. Use the helper's normalized output rather than
provider-specific fields. For list operations, request the compatibility variants and let the
helper union matches by issue number before signature deduplication.

The targeted issue-comment update operation is `issue-comment-update`. Its input contains the
issue number, the positive `commentId` returned by `issue-comments-read`, the freshly computed
`expectedBodyHash` of that exact comment body, and `payload.body`. It is a mutation and therefore
uses the normal dry-run-first envelope. On apply, the helper reads the issue comments again,
requires exactly one matching comment ID, and compares its body hash before writing. A missing,
ambiguous, or changed comment fails with `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`, or `STALE_WRITE`;
the caller must not fall back to `issue-comment` and create a competing comment.

Provider mapping for `issue-comment-update` is fixed and owned by the helper:

- GitHub: `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}`.
- Forgejo: `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{index}/comments/{id}`; Forgejo currently ignores
  `index`, but the adapter still supplies the freshly resolved issue number.

Both send a JSON object with the validated, attribution-free `body`. If probing reports that the
provider or installed CLI cannot execute this API operation, abort with `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`
before a write; never append a replacement planning comment.

Body writes, including `issue-comment-update`, require `expectedBodyHash` from the immediately
preceding fresh read. Preview the exact patch and command in dry-run mode, then apply with the same
payload. Zero or multiple semantic matches are structured errors; unchanged state is successful
and idempotent. The helper exposes whether provider-level conditional writes are available; the
expected-body precondition is mandatory regardless. GitHub returns the read ETag for diagnostics
but documents unsafe-method conditional requests as unsupported for these endpoints, so the
adapter reports the write as non-atomic instead of sending a misleading `If-Match` header.

Legacy-label transitions use the helper's add and remove operations in that order. The one-time `sf-` migration returns its completion marker only after every step succeeds; a partial failure reports completed steps and keeps the marker pending. Cleanup of recognized `firmo-` aliases uses the same add-before-remove operations without changing that one-time marker contract.

### Error and edge cases

- **Missing/unauthenticated CLI:** abort clearly, give a remediation hint, leave no partial state; no silent fallback to `local`.
- **No Git repository / no `origin` remote:** remote mode not possible; report.
- **Ambiguous host:** use `remoteToolOverride` or a per-run hint; if both are unclear, ask the user.
- **Argument type contradicts `tracker.mode`:** The argument type overrides the config mode for this run (see "Determine mode").

## Comment convention

Write the planning result as an issue comment (operation "Add comment" from the mapping). Resolve
`language.forge`, but preserve the clear language of an existing planning comment when updating
it. Begin every Effective Flow comment with the stable marker
`<!-- effective-flow-plan-issues -->`. The English structure is shown below. The complete German
form uses `Planung abgeschlossen`, `Empfohlener Workflow`, `Anforderung`,
`Akzeptanzkriterien`, `Betroffene Bereiche/Dateien`, `Randfälle`, and `Annahmen`. Workflow
values, paths, checklist syntax, and the HTML marker remain stable.

```markdown
<!-- effective-flow-plan-issues -->

The complete German form additionally uses `Plan-Review`, `Ergebnis`, `Freigegeben`,
`Überarbeitung nötig`, `Zusammenfassung`, `Befunde`, `Offene Punkte`, and
`Keine offenen Punkte.`. Preserve one complete language throughout the comment. An older comment
without review/open-point sections remains readable; the next baseline update adds both sections.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Tracker setup & collection

1. Determine the host and CLI and check availability/authentication according to "Host and CLI detection". Precondition: a Git repository with an `origin` remote. If something is missing: report clearly and abort.
2. Determine the issues to plan:
   - without an argument: list all open issues with the label `effective-flow-needs-planning` (also query the old label `firmo-needs-planning` as equivalent, see "Label convention").
   - with an argument: use the passed issue references (number, `#123`, URL).
3. If there are no matching issues: a short message ("no open `effective-flow-needs-planning` issues") and end.
4. Show the user the found list (number, title) and let them choose which issues should be planned (one, several, or all).
5. Create a task per chosen issue (task tracking).

Before planning, review useful skills according to the following building block. The no-code boundary of this
tool remains strict: skills only inform the clarification/planning, generate no code
and change nothing except the issue comments.

## Skill discovery

Before you start the actual implementation, planning, or review, survey the skills available in
the environment and pull in the ones useful for the concrete task. If the environment provides
no skill directory or none fits, this step is a no-op — continue without an error or a block.

### Approach

1. **Prefer recommended skills:** Preferentially apply the skills listed further above under
   "Recommended skills", provided they are available and relevant to the concrete task.
   "Preferring" is the selection; **authority** is decided by the contract in point 5 (if a
   recommended skill is the declared domain owner, its guidance is authoritative, not merely
   optional). A fallback notation `A › B` is an ordered preference: take the first available,
   non-excluded skill in the group, never both. If no such section exists (e.g. for tools),
   this point does not apply.
2. **Judge relevance:** Pull in only skills that clearly fit the **concrete** task (typically
   0–2), never "on suspicion". Never load the alternative orchestrator `effective-workflow`
   inside Effective Flow: nesting it would create competing lifecycle and delivery owners.
3. **Take config into account:** If present, read the `skills` block from the Effective Flow
   configuration (project-setup ADR) on a best-effort basis — the global fields plus your own
   scope entry (an agent reads `agents.<own-name>`, a tool reads `tools.<own-name>`).
   - `enabled: false` → skip the entire dynamic skill usage.
   - `exclude` (global or scope) → never apply these skills; an excluded fallback member is
     skipped in favor of the next fallback.
   - `include` (global or scope) → additionally consider these skills as preferred; a
     skill that is not installed is silently ignored.
   - If the block or the file is missing, the default applies (`enabled` on, no additional
     lists). Only read the config; do not migrate or write it here.
4. **Library docs:** For an unknown or current library or framework, use an available
   current-docs skill (e.g. `context7`) when needed instead of guessing from memory.
5. **Authority contract (orchestration vs. domain expertise):** Effective Flow and the central
   skills share the responsibility in a **layered** way — not "Effective Flow always wins":
   - **Effective Flow owns the orchestration** (the **what/when**): routing and user
     interaction, plan/report state, finding IDs, backlinks, tracker integration, resumability,
     agent selection and parallelization, baseline comparison, worktrees, commits, delivery,
     harness transform, and config. These rules, `AGENTS.md`/project conventions, plus its own
     language, commit, and scope rules **always** take precedence; no skill may widen scope,
     introduce new dependencies, or violate the agreed plan. In analysis/planning tools the
     no-code boundary stays strict.
   - **Central skills own reusable expertise** (the **how**): domain checklists, heuristics,
     standards, research procedures, and specialist guidance. If a recommended skill is the
     **declared domain owner** for the technical question at hand **and** covers it, its
     guidance is **authoritative** — not optional advice. The tool's own source then carries
     **no second copy** of that playbook, only scope/output/lifecycle constraints plus a
     minimal fallback (point 6).
   - **Edge cases:** If a skill only covers a special branch (_route-when-relevant_) or
     Effective Flow's product behavior deliberately diverges (_no-overlap_), the Effective Flow
     guidance stays leading. The binding assignment per skill/intersection is in the ownership
     inventory in the Developer Guide (`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`).
6. **Missing authoritative skill (minimal fallback):** If the authoritative skill is not
   available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`), the
   **minimal generic fallback** left in the source applies — a short, essential core guidance
   so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly. **No** second full domain handbook is
   kept on hand; full depth comes only with the central skill.
7. **Report:** Briefly name which skills were used (or that none fit). If an orchestrator tool
   already handed you relevant skills, apply them and do not run a redundant full discovery.

The generic plan-quality and plan-review **judgment** comes from `codebase-improvement`; Effective
Flow owns the issue-comment artifact, the per-issue lifecycle, and the readiness gate. Apply the
same central delegation contract as `effective-flow plan`:

## Delegating the domain judgment to central skills

The **generic technical judgment** of the calling tool — for planning, the plan-quality and
plan-review discipline (executable-plan sharpness, gap/drift checking, scope, evidence,
verification, maintenance focus) — is owned by the central skill `codebase-improvement`.
Effective Flow is the **artifact orchestrator** here, not a second domain handbook: the tool's
own source carries **no second copy** of these heuristics, but delegates the judgment and
normalizes the result into its own artifact contract (status, scorecard/finding form, open
points, handoff).

### What gets delegated (the "how" of the judgment)

- generic quality heuristics: over-engineering, scope creep, unspoken assumptions, missing or
  non-measurable acceptance criteria, edge cases, implementation risks, evidence vs. guessing,
  verifiability;
- the review **judgment** (which findings hold and how heavily they weigh) at the artifact
  level.

For this, apply `codebase-improvement`, provided it is available and relevant to the concrete
task; it is the **default owner** for this generic reasoning. Afterwards you bring the result
into the Effective Flow artifact form.

### Specialists only at a crossed boundary (one generic rule)

Declared domain owners are **not** hard-wired per skill, but loaded via **one** rule: if the
concrete task crosses the declared boundary of a specialist, load its owner via the relevance
gate (building block "Skill discovery") and the ownership inventory
(`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`). Typical owners:

<!-- skill-ownership:relevance-gate-owners ["product-management","product-design","effective-web","software-architecture","web-legal-compliance"] -->

- `product-management` — product outcomes, what/why/for-whom, prioritization, release judgment;
- `product-design` — research, problem framing, information architecture, flows, prototype;
- `effective-web` — browser implementation and accessibility detail;
- further declared owners (e.g. `software-architecture`, `web-legal-compliance`) analogously.

The relevance gate **keeps narrow tasks narrow**: a small engineering plan loads neither
product nor design owners, and product discovery is not forced.

### Authority contract and minimal fallback

The layered contract from the building block "Skill discovery" applies: Effective Flow owns the
**orchestration** (artifact lifecycle, status, open points, handoff, user interaction, and the
respective no-code/edit boundary), the central skills own the **domain judgment**. If the
authoritative skill is not available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via
`exclude`), a **minimal generic fallback** applies: a short, essential core checklist
(over-engineering, scope creep, missing measurable acceptance criteria, edge cases,
implementation risks) so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly — **not** a full local
handbook.

### Phase 2: Planning per issue (interactive)

For each chosen issue in turn:

1. Read the issue fresh from the tracker – **including comments** (operation
   `issue-comments-read`) – and examine the relevant codebase locally or with an internal analysis
   sub-agent. Take maintainer clarifications from comments into account. Find the newest comment
   carrying `<!-- effective-flow-plan-issues -->` or the backward-compatible
   `<!-- firmo-plan-issues -->`; retain its normalized positive comment ID, exact body, and body
   hash. Treat it as the canonical update basis. Never create a second planning comment while such
   a comment exists.
2. Apply the clarification methodology from `effective-flow plan` (Phase 1/2): identify the genuinely relevant ambiguities — target behavior, domain rules, technical requirements, dependencies, edge cases, acceptance criteria — and ask the user about them specifically.
3. Repeat the clarification until a reliable basis exists. Document unimportant remaining points as assumptions instead of blocking the process.
4. Determine the recommended implementation (Feature / Bugfix / Refactoring / Documentation) according to the classification definitions from `effective-flow plan`.
5. If a central clarification is unanswered, normalize it as an implementation-blocking open point,
   persist the current artifact per Phase 4, retain `effective-flow-needs-planning`, report the
   re-entry `effective-flow plan-issue <issue>`, and continue with the next selected issue.

### Phase 3: Automatic quality baseline per issue

Before offering the deep interactive review, run the same quality baseline as the local planning
workflow for the active issue only:

1. Ask `codebase-improvement` for the generic gap judgment from `effective-flow plan` Phase 4:
   over-engineering, scope creep, hidden assumptions, missing or non-measurable acceptance
   criteria, edge cases, implementation risks, and evidence versus guessing. Use another declared
   domain owner only when the issue crosses that specialist boundary.
2. Incorporate directly resolvable gaps into the specification. Normalize the validation judgment
   from `effective-flow plan` Phase 5: concrete scope and file references, measurable acceptance
   criteria, sufficient verified context, explicit purpose/workflow, no-code compliance, and a
   fitting workflow recommendation.
3. Obtain the internal plan-review judgment from `codebase-improvement` exactly as in
   `effective-flow plan` Phase 6. Classify findings as Critical, Important, or Note across Architecture,
   Security, Data protection, Error cases, Testability, Scope, and Maintainability. Incorporate all
   critical findings and every directly resolvable important finding; record remaining
   decision-requiring findings as concrete open points.
4. Normalize the active comment to the canonical structure, including its language-matching plan
   review, scorecard, findings, and open-points section. `Approved` / `Freigegeben` requires no
   critical finding and no implementation-blocking open point; otherwise use
   `Revision required` / `Überarbeitung nötig`.
5. If critical findings or implementation-blocking open points remain, persist the baseline,
   retain the Needs-Planning label, do **not** offer the deep review yet, report re-entry via
   `effective-flow plan-issue <issue>`, and continue with the next selected issue.

### Phase 4: Persist, deep-review gate, and readiness

Complete this entire phase for the active issue before starting another issue:

1. Persist the self-contained baseline comment. If no planning comment exists, use
   `planning-comment-build` followed by `issue-comment` once and retain the returned comment ID and
   fresh body hash. If one exists, canonicalize the marker to
   `<!-- effective-flow-plan-issues -->`, preview `issue-comment-update` with the retained comment
   ID and `expectedBodyHash`, then apply that same payload. On `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`,
   `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`, or `STALE_WRITE`, stop processing this issue without
   adding a fallback comment or removing its label; report that a fresh
   `effective-flow plan-issue <issue>` run is required.
2. With a baseline that has no critical findings, ask for this issue only:

Ask the user: **Start the deep interactive plan review now?**
- Yes -- Search now for unknown, imprecise, and decision-requiring points
- No -- Continue later via plan-issue <issue>

Do not reuse this answer for any other selected issue.

- On **Yes**, read ``tools/plan-review.md`` and invoke it in **issue mode** with exactly this issue,
  the current canonical planning-comment ID and body, its freshly computed body hash, the
  already-resolved tracker adapter, and the concrete artifact language. The internal review may
  update only this existing comment and returns whether implementation-blocking open points
  remain. Do not create a plan file or a second comment.
- On **No**, retain the approved automatic baseline, record no artificial open point, and name
  `effective-flow plan-issue <issue>` as the optional later re-entry.

After either branch, apply the readiness decision. If the deep review is ended, deferred after it
starts, fails to persist, or returns a blocking open point, keep or add
`effective-flow-needs-planning` and persist the exact re-entry need in the comment. Otherwise
remove `effective-flow-needs-planning` and any present `firmo-needs-planning` variant. Never set
`effective-flow-issue-done`.

Set the issue task to `completed`, annotated `[blocked]` when it was not released, and continue
with the next selected issue. One blocked issue must not prevent the remaining issues from
receiving their own baseline, question, comment update, and label decision.

### Phase 5: Summary

Report per issue whether it was released for implementation, retained for planning with its open
points, or failed closed during comment persistence. Mention `effective-flow apply <issue>` only for
released issues and `effective-flow plan-issue <issue>` for later or blocked review. This skill itself
implements nothing.

## Rules

- Do not change any implementation files and generate no code.
- Do not create any `<plan.dir>/` file.
- If clarification, baseline, or deep review does not enable a reliable plan, leave
  `effective-flow-needs-planning` in place and document the blocking decision in the canonical
  comment's open-points section.
- A nonempty open-points section is implementation-blocking. Never remove the Needs-Planning
  label while an entry remains.
- Process multiple issues artifact by artifact. Questions and answers apply only to the currently
  named issue.
- Never set `Co-Authored-By` trailers and do not expose internal IDs in comments.
- Give the user a brief status update after each phase.
