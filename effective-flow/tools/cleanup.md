# Effective Flow Cleanup

You clean up the legacy remnants that Effective Flow's migrations deliberately leave behind. All migrations are **non-destructive** and explicitly defer the actual deletion to the user (see `effective-flow-dir-migration.md`: "Effective Flow leaves the cleanup to the user"; `effective-flow setup`: the untracked old `config.json` is "left on disk"). This skill is the sanctioned, user-driven path that handles this finalization — and the **only** place that actually deletes old data.

## Goal

- capture all outdated migration artifacts in the current project (discovery)
- check them against their new counterpart and determine whether anything still needs to be carried over (carry-over)
- have the user confirm every carry-over candidate and carry over what is confirmed
- then delete the old data **git-aware** and only after explicit confirmation (dry run first)
- never delete before the new counterpart exists and the carry-over is complete or deliberately discarded
- inventory outdated `.gitignore` entries but leave them untouched and route their repair to `effective-flow setup`
- do not create a commit and do not create a backup directory
- be a no-op with a clear message when no legacy remnants are present

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/runtime-state-safety.md`, when any confirmed legacy copy or removal, runtime migration, memory, or tracker-marker mutation is imminent.

## Runtime directory `.effective-flow/` and migration from `.firmo/`/`.sf-plugin/`

Effective Flow keeps project-local runtime data under `.effective-flow/` (`memory.json`,
`cache.json`, `review/`, `investigation/`, `.worktrees/`, and wisdom files; a legacy
`config.json` may still be present as transitional input, but configuration migration to the
project-setup ADR is owned by `effective-flow setup`). Earlier versions used `.firmo/`, and still older
ones used `.sf-plugin/`.

Every workflow that can mutate `.effective-flow/` must load this fragment after
“Runtime-state write safety” and run the following prerequisite before its **first** runtime
write. Merely finding `.effective-flow/` does not prove that migration ran. The stable,
versioned completion marker is the JSON value `runtimeMigration.directory.version: 1` in
`.effective-flow/memory.json`.

Resolve every current and legacy runtime path from the retained, verified
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. All reads, inventories, copies, collision decisions, and the final memory
write use absolute handles below that main checkout. Never scan or mutate a legacy/current
runtime tree below a linked execution worktree.

## Shared memory-state mutation

Every mutation of the retained absolute
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle uses this one repository-wide protocol.
This includes finding-number reservations, migration of
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json`,
`runtimeMigration.directory`, `labelMigration.sf`, `configMigration.adr`, and every future
field. The owning workflow must already have loaded “Runtime-state write safety”; the runtime
directory migration prerequisite loads this fragment for its own marker and for all later
writers. Do not add a writer-specific lock or direct JSON rewrite.

Resolve the canonical file, legacy file, lock, owner record, and temporary file from the retained,
verified `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. Run every guard from that root and use the resulting absolute
handles below the main checkout. Never inspect, lock, migrate, or mutate a same-named path below
`EXECUTION_ROOT` or another linked execution worktree.

### Acquire and own the lock

1. Generate a unique, unguessable lock token for this session. Apply “Runtime-state write
   safety” from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` to the exact target `.effective-flow/memory.lock`, then
   acquire the retained absolute lock exclusively with the atomic command
   `mkdir <RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.lock`. A successful `mkdir` is the only
   evidence of acquisition; checking for absence first grants nothing.
2. As the first operation after acquisition, write
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.lock/owner.json` exclusively with at least the
   token, workflow/session identifier, and UTC acquisition timestamp; include the host and process
   ID when available. Guard this concrete absolute target before writing it. If the owner record
   cannot be written, remove the newly acquired empty lock directory only if it is still the lock
   from this acquisition, then fail.
3. If `mkdir` reports that the lock exists, retry with a short bounded delay for no more than 30
   seconds total. Do not mutate memory or publish an artifact while waiting. On timeout, read the
   owner record without changing it and report the recorded owner, session, and timestamp (or
   that the record is missing or invalid) with the lock path.
4. Never infer that age alone makes a lock disposable. A missing or malformed owner record, an
   apparently inactive process, or an unusually old timestamp makes it only an apparent orphan.
   Ask for explicit user confirmation before removing an apparent orphan. After confirmation,
   re-read the owner record and verify that the observed token or exact missing-record state is
   unchanged before guarded removal; otherwise leave it for its current owner and retry normally.
5. Normal release must release only its own lock: re-read `owner.json`, require the exact token
   from this acquisition, remove that owned record, and remove the lock directory only if empty.
   A mismatch or foreign entry is reported and left untouched. Use a `finally`/trap-equivalent
   release on handled failures; an abrupt interruption may leave an apparent orphan for the
   confirmed recovery path above.

### Mutate a fresh object and replace it atomically

While holding the lock:

1. Re-read the retained absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle inside
   the lock. If it exists, use it as the base object. If it is absent, select the base exactly once
   through “Legacy `.sf-memory.json`” below: a valid, unchanged runtime-root legacy file is the
   base, otherwise the base is an empty object. Existing or legacy content must be valid JSON and
   a JSON object. If present, `lastFindingNumber` must be a nonnegative safe integer. Invalid JSON,
   a non-object value, or an invalid `lastFindingNumber` fails clearly; never default, repair, or
   overwrite it destructively.
2. Merge only the field or subtree owned by the current operation into that fresh object.
   Preserve all other known or unknown fields with the same JSON meaning. A subtree writer
   re-reads and merges sibling keys rather than replacing their parent. The directory migration
   recursively adds only absent legacy keys with the fresh target winning every conflict; a
   marker writer updates only its named marker; a reservation updates only
   `lastFindingNumber`.
3. Serialize the complete merged object, including a trailing newline, to a same-directory unique
   absolute file such as
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/.memory.json.<session>.<token>.tmp`. Guard the concrete
   temporary path from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, create it exclusively, finish and close the write,
   and flush it when the host supports that operation. Never truncate or stream partial content
   into `memory.json`.
4. Apply “Runtime-state write safety” from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` to the absolute canonical memory
   handle immediately before an atomic rename of the owned temporary file over the target.
   Because the temporary file is in the same directory, readers see either the previous complete
   object or the new complete object. If writing, flushing, or replacement fails—including
   permissions or disk-full errors—the prior `memory.json` remains the source of truth. Report the
   concrete failure and clean up only this operation's own temporary file; never delete a foreign
   temporary file or lock.
5. Release the owned lock only after the atomic replacement succeeds or the failure has been
   handled. A successful replacement is committed memory state and is never rolled back to
   compensate for a later artifact or remote-operation failure.

### Reserve finding IDs before publication

A producer must finish confidence filtering, design-decision filtering, and local or remote
deduplication before it knows the findings that will actually be new. If none remain, reserve
nothing and do not write `lastFindingNumber`. Otherwise:

1. Let `N` be the exact positive number of new findings. Acquire the lock, validate the fresh
   object and counter, and reserve the exact nonzero contiguous range
   `lastFindingNumber + 1` through `lastFindingNumber + N` by atomically persisting the upper
   bound under this protocol.
2. Record the ordered finding-to-ID mapping in in-run state, release the lock, and only then—before
   publishing any report, finding issue, or epic—use that reserved mapping. Concurrent producers
   therefore receive disjoint ranges.
3. Failure before the reservation is persisted prevents all publication. Failure or interruption
   after reservation never decrements or reuses the counter: unpublished IDs become permanent
   gaps, which are harmless evidence of monotonic allocation. Report the reserved range and any
   artifacts that were published before the interruption; on retry, deduplicate again and reserve
   a new range for whatever still needs publication.

### Legacy `.sf-memory.json`

Legacy adoption is never a preliminary migration or a separate write. For **every** writer—such
as the runtime-directory marker, label marker, config marker, or finding-range reservation—the
same locked transaction performs these steps when canonical memory is absent:

1. Inside the acquired lock, re-check the absolute
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle. If another compliant writer created
   it, use that fresh canonical object and leave `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json` untouched.
2. Otherwise, if `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json` exists, read it once, record its file
   identity and content digest, and validate it as the initial object, including
   `lastFindingNumber`. Invalid or unreadable legacy content fails the whole transaction; never
   replace it with an empty object.
3. Merge the current writer's intended mutation into that same initial object. Thus a
   runtime-directory prerequisite adds `runtimeMigration.directory` without losing the legacy
   counter; a label/config marker adds only its subtree; and a reservation allocates from the
   legacy `lastFindingNumber`.
4. Immediately before replacement, verify that the absolute legacy handle is unchanged by identity
   and digest. A change fails before canonical persistence. Otherwise write the combined base plus
   current mutation through one temporary file and one atomic replacement of canonical memory.
5. Only after that replacement succeeds, re-check that the legacy identity and digest still
   match, then remove `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json`. If it changed, do not remove it and
   report the conflict; if removal alone fails, report that cleanup failure without rolling back
   committed canonical memory.

For example, root legacy memory with `lastFindingNumber: 41` plus the runtime-directory
prerequisite produces one canonical object that retains `41` and adds the directory marker. A
following two-finding reservation therefore allocates `R-0000042`–`R-0000043` and persists `43`.
Never let the prerequisite publish its marker first and thereby hide the root legacy counter.

Timeout, invalid state, permission failure, disk exhaustion, failed replacement, or loss of lock
ownership blocks the owning mutation and every publication that depends on it. Preserve foreign
state, give the exact path and error, and leave confirmed recovery or repair to the user.

1. **Read without creating anything.** Read the absolute
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle when present. A valid
   marker makes the prerequisite a no-op. A missing marker starts the migration scan even when
   `.effective-flow/` already contains a transitional `config.json`, wisdom file, report, cache,
   worktree, or unrelated memory fields. Do not create a runtime footprint during a read-only
   run; this prerequisite is activated only because a workflow-specific runtime write is already
   authorized and imminent. When canonical memory is absent, do not write the marker yet: the
   locked memory transaction in Step 5 must first adopt a valid absolute
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json` as its base.
2. **Choose exactly one legacy source.** Use the whole `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/` tree when
   it exists; otherwise use `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-plugin/` when it exists. If both exist, do
   not combine them. Preserve both legacy
   directories unchanged. If neither exists, proceed directly to the final marker update as part
   of the already-authorized first runtime write, without a separate eager migration write.
3. **Validate before carrying state over.** Inventory the selected source without mutation. All
   entries required for the merge must be readable. If either present `memory.json` is invalid
   JSON, is not a JSON object, or cannot be read, a safe memory merge is impossible: report the
   path and error, leave the completion marker unset, perform none of the workflow-specific
   runtime writes, and retry on a later run. Do not reinterpret configuration or migrate it to an
   ADR here; that remains `effective-flow setup`’s responsibility.
4. **Merge the directory tree without replacing target state.** Walk the chosen legacy tree
   recursively, except for the entire `.worktrees/` subtree: legacy worktrees are path-registered
   and remain only in the legacy directory. For every other relative path, an existing target
   path wins regardless of type, timestamp, or content. Create only missing target directories
   and copy only missing files—including `cache.json`, report or investigation trees, and wisdom
   files—using no-clobber or exclusive-create semantics so a target that appears concurrently
   still wins. Apply “Runtime-state write safety” separately and immediately before each concrete
   `mkdir` or copy target. Treat `memory.json` specially under step 5 instead of copying it as a
   normal file. A copy, read, or guard failure stops the merge, leaves the marker unset, preserves
   both legacy directories and all target entries already carried over, blocks the
   workflow-specific runtime write with an actionable error, and allows the next run to retry
   the remaining missing paths.
5. **Merge memory recursively under the shared contract, target wins.** Use “Shared memory-state
   mutation” above; do not introduce a migration-specific lock or direct writer. Inside its lock,
   select the retained absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle or a
   valid unchanged `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.sf-memory.json` as the base, then merge the selected
   legacy directory's `memory.json` by recursively adding only keys absent from that freshest
   base. At every scalar, array, object, or type conflict preserve the base value. After every
   directory copy has succeeded, add only `runtimeMigration.directory.version: 1` and atomically
   persist the base, directory merge, and marker in one replacement. Never reduce or replace
   existing counters, migration markers, status, or unrelated fields.
6. **Certify only success.** The marker is the final migration mutation and is written only after
   all safe carry-over work succeeds. A run with no legacy source records it as part of the first
   authorized runtime write. Once version `1` is present, later prerequisites skip the legacy
   scan and are idempotent. An interrupted or concurrent run with no marker retries; it never
   deletes legacy data, overwrites target paths, or treats a partially populated target as proof
   of completion.

The `.gitignore` switch to a single `.effective-flow/` entry—including migration of the earlier
two-line pattern `.effective-flow/*` plus `!.effective-flow/config.json`, as well as a blanket
`.firmo/` or `.sf-plugin/` ignore line—is handled only by `effective-flow setup`. Deletion of preserved
legacy directories remains an explicit, user-confirmed responsibility of `effective-flow cleanup`.

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to effective-flow setup. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers (effective-flow setup, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, effective-flow setup may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, effective-flow setup may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:start -->

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in effective-flow setup.

Outside effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to effective-flow setup.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:end -->

## Issue-tracker integration (remote mode)

This shared fragment connects `effective-flow review` and ``tools/apply-review.md`` with an external issue tracker (GitHub via `gh`, Forgejo via `tea`). It is **opt-in** via the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) and disabled by default (`local`). In local mode both skills behave unchanged – findings run through the Markdown report file under `.effective-flow/review/`, no issues are created and no CLI is invoked.

The local/remote toggle (`tracker.mode`) affects exclusively **reviews**. **Investigations** (`effective-flow investigate`) are exempt from it and remain purely local in every mode under `.effective-flow/investigation/` (never committed, never as an issue). Of the Effective Flow artifacts, only **plans** are committed.

It encapsulates the **shared** building blocks: the `tracker` config schema including migration, the mode determination, the provider-neutral remote-helper contract, the label convention, and the canonical issue and epic body formats. The actual orchestration – when issues are **created** (`effective-flow review`) and when they are **read and processed** (``tools/apply-review.md``) – stays in the respective skill.

In addition, ``tools/apply-issues.md`` and `effective-flow plan-issue` use this fragment for the same provider-neutral helper operations. These two skills process **arbitrary** human issues instead of the finding issues produced by `effective-flow review`; they are **inherently remote** and do **not** evaluate the `tracker.mode` toggle (local/remote) – they only need a Git repository, an `origin` remote and an authenticated CLI. The finding-/epic-specific sections (issue body format, epic body format, `R-XXXXXXX` convention) apply only to `effective-flow review`/``tools/apply-review.md``; the checkbox-ticking mechanics for epic bodies are used by ``tools/apply-issues.md`` analogously for container issues.

### Configuration

Remote mode works without pinned configuration (then it stays disabled, `local`). If the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) pins corresponding values, they override these defaults (schema shown here for illustration):

```json
{
  "tracker": {
    "mode": "local",
    "remoteToolOverride": "auto"
  }
}
```

Missing values have these defaults:

- `tracker.mode`: `"local"` (feature off)
- `tracker.remoteToolOverride`: `"auto"` (tool automatically from the `origin` URL)

Valid values:

- `tracker.mode`: `"local"`, `"remote"`
- `tracker.remoteToolOverride`: `"auto"`, `"github"`, `"forgejo"`

`remoteToolOverride` is intended only for ambiguous hosts (e.g. self-hosted GitHub Enterprise whose domain does not contain `github.com`). With `auto` the host detection below decides.

### Config migration

Reading the Effective Flow configuration from the project setup ADR (including the `tracker` keys) and the one-time migration of a legacy config is handled centrally by the fragment "Config migration" (`config-migration.md`); this fragment performs no own per-block migration for `tracker` anymore. The `tracker` config schema above (configuration, valid values, mode determination, first-invocation query) remains unaffected by this.

### Determine mode

At the start of the run, determine the effective mode in this order (the first matching rule wins):

1. **Argument type:** The passed argument type overrides the config mode for this run. A report file (`*.md` under `.effective-flow/review/`) forces `local`; an issue reference (issue number, `#123` or an issue URL) forces `remote`.
2. **Per-run wish of the user:** If the user explicitly requests issue/tracker work, `remote` is active; if they explicitly request local work ("local", "without issues", "report only"), `local` is active.
3. **Config:** otherwise `tracker.mode` from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) applies.
4. **First-invocation query:** If `tracker.mode` is not set in the config and neither argument nor per-run wish delivers a signal, run the first-invocation query below.

### First-invocation query

Only when step 4 above applies (no config value, no argument/per-run signal):

Ask the user: **Should review findings be tracked locally as a Markdown report or remotely as issues (GitHub/Forgejo)?**
- Local -- tracker.mode = local — Markdown report under .effective-flow/review/ (previous behavior)
- Remote -- tracker.mode = remote — findings as issues, tool automatically from origin (gh/tea)

Use the chosen answer as the tracker mode **for this run**. Do **not** write it into the configuration yourself — permanently pinning `tracker.mode` in the project setup ADR is handled exclusively by `effective-flow setup`. Briefly point this out to the user, e.g. "Tracker mode `remote` used for this run; pin permanently via `effective-flow setup`."

### Remote helper contract (remote mode only)

All deterministic remote mechanics run through the shipped helper:

```text
node <skill-root>/scripts/remote-tracker.mjs <operation> [--apply]
```

Pass exactly one JSON object through standard input and parse exactly one JSON result envelope from standard output. Resolve `<skill-root>` from the currently loaded Effective Flow skill; never copy the helper into the target project. The helper owns origin/provider/reference parsing, `gh`/`tea` probing, capability normalization, command construction, JSON normalization, payload validation, compatibility aliases, exact body patching, redaction, and stale-write preconditions. It never opens a shell and never prompts.

For `finding-build` and `epic-build`, pass the already-resolved `language.forge` as the top-level
`language: en|de`; this applies equally when the finding or epic data is nested under its named
key. The optional field defaults to `en`, and unsupported values are rejected. The helper returns
the same language-stable payload keys in either language.

Successful envelopes contain `ok`, `operation`, `provider`, `data`, and `dryRun`. Failed envelopes additionally contain `error.code`, `error.message`, redacted `error.details`, and `error.retryable`, and the process exits nonzero. Treat errors as workflow input; do not discover flags, assemble API requests, read CLI credentials, or invent a fallback. In particular:

- `AMBIGUOUS_HOST`: obtain an explicit `github`/`forgejo` choice from configuration or the user, then retry with that override.
- `CLI_MISSING`/`AUTH_FAILED`: abort without side effects; offer local mode only with explicit user consent.
- `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`: report the unsupported provider capability and preserve the surrounding workflow state.
- `STALE_WRITE`: abort that write without retrying, merging, or overwriting; re-enter the workflow from a fresh read.
- all other structured errors: preserve scope and let the owning workflow decide whether a retry is safe.

Reads execute immediately. Mutations are dry runs by default: inspect the returned executable, argument vector, and redacted input preview, obtain every workflow-specific approval that still applies, and only then repeat the same operation with `--apply`. A dry run never changes Git, tracker state, memory, labels, issues, pull requests, comments, or review threads.

### Label convention

In remote mode, use these labels and create missing labels idempotently (tolerate an "already exists" message, do not treat it as an error):

| Label                                                                                          | Meaning                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `effective-flow-review-finding`                                                                | marks a single finding issue                                                      |
| `effective-flow-review-epic`                                                                   | marks the epic/tracking issue                                                     |
| `effective-flow-fix`, `effective-flow-refactor`, `effective-flow-build`, `effective-flow-docs` | target action of the finding (exactly one per finding issue)                      |
| `critical`, `important`, `note`                                                                | severity of the finding (exactly one per finding issue; `note` for note findings) |
| `wontfix`                                                                                      | deliberately do not implement finding → ADR instead of code                       |
| `effective-flow-issue-done`                                                                    | issue implemented by ``tools/apply-issues.md`` (PR created)                        |
| `effective-flow-needs-planning`                                                                | skipped by ``tools/apply-issues.md``; planning via `effective-flow plan-issue` needed   |

`wontfix` already exists on many trackers; create it only if it is missing. `effective-flow-issue-done` and `effective-flow-needs-planning` belong to the issue-driven flow (``tools/apply-issues.md``/`effective-flow plan-issue`) and are created idempotently there.

**Backward compatibility (severity labels):** The English severity labels `critical`/`important`/`note` are the default; newly created or set is exclusively the English label. The former German labels `kritisch`/`wichtig`/`hinweis` are **not** upgraded but stay **recognized** permanently when reading, listing, deduplicating and detecting a finding's severity — run a severity query per language variant (once `critical`/`important`/`note`, once `kritisch`/`wichtig`/`hinweis`) and union by issue number, analogous to the `firmo-`/`effective-flow-` prefix rule above.

**Backward compatibility (legacy prefix `firmo-`):** Earlier versions used the prefix `firmo-` instead of `effective-flow-` (`firmo-review-finding`, `firmo-review-epic`, `firmo-fix`/`firmo-refactor`/`firmo-build`/`firmo-docs`, `firmo-issue-done`, `firmo-needs-planning`). Newly **created or set** is exclusively the `effective-flow-` label; an upgrade of existing `firmo-` labels is **not** needed. When **reading, listing, deduplicating and detecting**, every `firmo-` variant counts permanently as equivalent to the associated `effective-flow-` variant:

- **Listing/filtering** (dedup, epic/issue search): `gh`/`tea` combine multiple `--label` specifications with AND semantics. Therefore run the query **separately per prefix** (once `effective-flow-…`, once `firmo-…`) and union the matches by the issue number.
- **Removing a status label** (`effective-flow-needs-planning`, `effective-flow-issue-done`): additionally remove the legacy `firmo-` variant, if present, so an issue does not stay "stuck" through a leftover legacy label.

**One-time `sf-` label migration:** The even older prefix `sf-` (`sf-review-finding`, `sf-review-epic`, `sf-fix`/`sf-refactor`/`sf-build`/`sf-docs`, `sf-issue-done`, `sf-needs-planning`) is **no longer** detected continuously, but **migrated once per repo**. On the **first** remote tracker access — provided the marker `labelMigration.sf.done` in the retained absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/memory.json` handle is missing and an authenticated CLI is present — an idempotent migration moves every still-present `sf-<x>` label to `effective-flow-<x>`: first add `effective-flow-<x>` on the issue, then remove `sf-<x>` (not the other way around, so an abort leaves no issue unclassified). If the runtime directory is missing, apply the owning workflow's loaded “Runtime-state write safety” contract from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` to that exact directory immediately before its `mkdir`. After the remote migration, use the loaded shared memory mutation contract against the retained absolute memory handle: acquire its lock, re-read memory, merge only `labelMigration.sf`, and atomically persist `done` plus the completion timestamp while preserving every sibling and unknown field. If this marker mutation blocks or fails, preserve local state, report that the remote labels may already have migrated, and direct the user to `effective-flow setup`; the next run may repeat the idempotent remote migration. If the migration finds no `sf-` labels, it is a silent no-op. If the marker is set, any further scan is skipped — ongoing operations know only `effective-flow-` and `firmo-`. `sf-` is referenced exclusively in this migration.

### No AI attribution in issue bodies and comments

Do not add AI attribution to issue bodies, epic bodies and comments: no "Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers, no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) and no `Co-Authored-By` trailers – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex as the target harness are allowed, generation attribution is not.

### Remote prose language

Resolve `language.forge` once per remote run and pass it to all issue/comment writers. Preserve
the clear language of an existing issue or thread when editing/replying; otherwise use the
resolved Forge language. Finding and epic bodies use one complete language for human-readable
titles, headings, field labels, displayed severity/complexity values, and prose.

The German display mapping is `Schweregrad`, `Komplexität`, `Bereich`, `Datei`, `Problem`,
`Empfehlung`, `Prompt-Vorschlag`, `Befunde`, and
`Übersprungen (Architekturentscheidungen)`. English uses the template labels below. `Action`,
`Epic`, and `Signature` are stable helper/dedup fields and remain canonical English in both
forms, as do their action values. Displayed severities map to
`Kritisch`/`Wichtig`/`Hinweis`, and displayed complexities map to
`Niedrig`/`Mittel`/`Hoch`; their helper input enums remain
`Critical`/`Important`/`Note` and `Low`/`Medium`/`High`. Labels, issue numbers, `R-XXXXXXX` IDs, HTML markers, body
hashes, checklist syntax, and helper payload keys are never localized. Readers accept both
German and English historical display fields, including legacy `Signatur`, but canonical writes
use `Signature`.

### Issue body format (finding issue)

A finding issue must be **self-contained**: a foreign LLM session must be able to process it without access to the producing session. It contains the same content fields as a finding block of the local report format (see `effective-flow review`, "Report format").

- **Title:** `[R-XXXXXXX] <short title in language.forge>`
- **Labels:** `effective-flow-review-finding`, the action label and the severity label.
- **Body** (canonical template):

```markdown
- **Severity**: Critical / Important / Note
- **Complexity**: Low / Medium / High
- **Area**: [...]
- **File**: [path:line]
- **Problem**: [...]
- **Recommendation**: [...]
- **Action**: effective-flow-fix | effective-flow-refactor | effective-flow-build | effective-flow-docs
- **Prompt suggestion**: [directly copy-pasteable plain text, without enclosing quotation marks, without escape sequences]
- **Epic**: #<epic number> (empty if no epic)
- **Signature**: [path:line] · [Area] · [short summary of the problem]  <!-- Dedup key -->
```

The **Signature** field fixes the content dedup key (file+line, area, problem). It is deliberately **not** the `R-XXXXXXX` ID, because that is assigned freshly per run. Canonical writes use `Signature`; helper reads and deduplication also accept the legacy field name `Signatur` and normalize both forms to the same identity.

### Epic body format (tracking issue)

- **Title:** `Code review YYYY-MM-DD[-N]` for English or
  `Code-Review YYYY-MM-DD[-N]` for German
- **Labels:** `effective-flow-review-epic`
- **Body** (canonical template):

```markdown
Code review of YYYY-MM-DD · Scope: [Entire code / Described area] · Project type: [...]

## Findings

- [ ] #<nr> [R-0000001] <short title> — Action: effective-flow-fix
- [ ] #<nr> [R-0000002] <short title> — Action: effective-flow-refactor

## Skipped (design decisions)

- <short title> — Signature: [normalized signature] — covered by [decision reference] ([Source])
```

Rules for the task list:

- Each entry under `## Findings` references exactly one finding issue via its number and carries the `R-XXXXXXX` ID as well as the action.
- The section `## Skipped (design decisions)` uses **no** checkboxes and lists only findings filtered out by design decisions. A skipped entry is identified by title, normalized signature, and decision reference; it carries no issue number and no `R-XXXXXXX` ID, and it never advances `lastFindingNumber`. The section is omitted when no such findings are present.
- Ticking off delegates the exact checklist patch to the helper, using the body hash from the preceding fresh read. It may append the PR link; a finding deliberately not implemented is marked with its decision reference.

### Tracker operations

Describe tracker access only as a helper operation: issue/PR read and list, issue/PR create,
comment read/create/update, label create/change, PR review-thread read/reply/resolve,
marker/checklist patch, or PR creation. Use the helper's normalized output rather than
provider-specific fields. For list operations, request the compatibility variants and let the
helper union matches by issue number before signature deduplication.

The targeted issue-comment update operation is `issue-comment-update`. Its input contains the
issue number, the positive `commentId` returned by `issue-comments-read`, the freshly computed
`expectedBodyHash` of that exact comment body, and `payload.body`. It is a mutation and therefore
uses the normal dry-run-first envelope. On apply, the helper reads the issue comments again,
requires exactly one matching comment ID, and compares its body hash before writing. A missing,
ambiguous, or changed comment fails with `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`, or `STALE_WRITE`;
the caller must not fall back to `issue-comment` and create a competing comment.

Provider mapping for `issue-comment-update` is fixed and owned by the helper:

- GitHub: `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}`.
- Forgejo: `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{index}/comments/{id}`; Forgejo currently ignores
  `index`, but the adapter still supplies the freshly resolved issue number.

Both send a JSON object with the validated, attribution-free `body`. If probing reports that the
provider or installed CLI cannot execute this API operation, abort with `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`
before a write; never append a replacement planning comment.

Body writes, including `issue-comment-update`, require `expectedBodyHash` from the immediately
preceding fresh read. Preview the exact patch and command in dry-run mode, then apply with the same
payload. Zero or multiple semantic matches are structured errors; unchanged state is successful
and idempotent. The helper exposes whether provider-level conditional writes are available; the
expected-body precondition is mandatory regardless. GitHub returns the read ETag for diagnostics
but documents unsafe-method conditional requests as unsupported for these endpoints, so the
adapter reports the write as non-atomic instead of sending a misleading `If-Match` header.

Legacy-label transitions use the helper's add and remove operations in that order. The one-time `sf-` migration returns its completion marker only after every step succeeds; a partial failure reports completed steps and keeps the marker pending. Cleanup of recognized `firmo-` aliases uses the same add-before-remove operations without changing that one-time marker contract.

### Error and edge cases

- **Missing/unauthenticated CLI:** abort clearly, give a remediation hint, leave no partial state; no silent fallback to `local`.
- **No Git repository / no `origin` remote:** remote mode not possible; report.
- **Ambiguous host:** use `remoteToolOverride` or a per-run hint; if both are unclear, ask the user.
- **Argument type contradicts `tracker.mode`:** The argument type overrides the config mode for this run (see "Determine mode").

## Project conventions

If the project has an `AGENTS.md`, read it before cleaning up and follow its guidance on file formats, configuration, and project-wide conventions.

## Hard scope boundary

- **Only the current project.** This skill does **not** touch any global skill installation (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/effective-flow` or `~/.claude/skills/firmo`, `firmo-*`/`effective-flow-*` agents). Removing old installed skills/agents is done by the deploy scripts, not this tool.
- **Never delete the new.** The active runtime directory `.effective-flow/` (except for legacy content within it that is explicitly recognized as outdated, see legacy classes) and the project setup ADR are **never** deleted.
- **No auto-commit.** The skill at most stages `git rm` changes and removes untracked files physically; it does not commit. Committing is done by the user or `effective-flow commit`.
- **No backup.** For artifacts that are not git-recoverable, no backup directory is deliberately created; the safety net is the explicit confirmation.
- **Do not write config.** This skill does not itself write carried-over config values into the project setup ADR — `effective-flow setup` is responsible for that (see Phase 3).
- **Do not edit `.gitignore`.** Inventory and report outdated entries, then route normalization
  to `effective-flow setup`, the sole repair owner.
- **Delete only with consent.** Every deletion happens only after a dry run and explicit confirmation.

## Legacy classes

The skill knows exactly these four classes of migration remnants, each with its new counterpart:

| Class                       | Legacy remnant                                                                                                                                 | New counterpart                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime directories         | `.firmo/`, `.sf-plugin/` (deliberately left after migration)                                                                                   | `.effective-flow/`                              |
| Legacy `config.json`        | untracked `.firmo/config.json` or a legacy `config.json` in a runtime directory                                                                | project setup ADR (see `effective-flow setup`)       |
| Legacy `.gitignore` entries | outdated ignore lines for `.firmo/`/`.sf-plugin/` or the old two-line pattern `.effective-flow/*` + `!.effective-flow/config.json`             | the single line `.effective-flow/`              |
| `firmo-` labels             | `firmo-review-finding`, `firmo-review-epic`, `firmo-fix`/`-refactor`/`-build`/`-docs`, `firmo-issue-done`, `firmo-needs-planning` on the issue | the `effective-flow-` variant on the same issue |

`sf-` labels are **not** a standalone target: they are already moved to `effective-flow-` by the one-time `sf-` label migration (see "Label convention" in `issue-tracker.md`). This skill only clears up remaining `firmo-` labels.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery / inventory

1. Capture the existing legacy remnants in the project root:
   - **Runtime directories:** do `.firmo/` and/or `.sf-plugin/` exist?
   - **Legacy `config.json`:** does `.firmo/config.json`, `.sf-plugin/config.json`, or a `config.json` recognizable as outdated in `.effective-flow/` (transitional fallback whose values belong in the ADR) exist?
   - **`.gitignore`:** does it contain outdated lines for `.firmo/`/`.sf-plugin/` or the old two-line pattern?
   - **`firmo-` labels:** only in remote mode with an authenticated CLI (see "Host and CLI detection" in `issue-tracker.md`) — list issues with `firmo-` labels separately per prefix. If remote mode, a Git repository, `origin`, or an authenticated CLI is missing, skip this class and report that briefly.
2. For each existing legacy remnant, determine whether its **new counterpart** exists (`.effective-flow/`, project setup ADR, or `effective-flow-` labels).
3. If no legacy remnants are present, the run is a **no-op**: report that clearly and end.
4. Give the user a compact inventory (class → artifacts found → whether a new counterpart exists).

### Phase 2: Carry-over check (read + compare)

Read the legacy remnants and determine whether anything still needs to be carried over before deleting:

- **Runtime directories:** Compare the content of the legacy directory (preferring `.firmo/` over `.sf-plugin/`) with `.effective-flow/`. Collect files that are present in the legacy directory but **missing** in `.effective-flow/` (or differ in content / are newer) as carry-over candidates. Pure runtime artifacts (`cache.json`, `.worktrees/`) are usually dispensable; name them as such.
- **Legacy `config.json`:** Parse it. If it is not valid JSON, it is **not** a carry-over source: report the path and error and treat the file only as a deletion candidate (after confirmation). For valid JSON, compare each set value with the project setup ADR; values not represented there are carry-over candidates.
- **`.gitignore`/labels:** no file carry-over. For labels, the add-before-remove step in Phase 5 applies.

### Phase 3: Confirm and perform carry-over

Present the carry-over candidates to the user grouped and obtain a decision per group. Carry over only explicitly confirmed candidates.

If there are runtime file candidates that are missing in `.effective-flow/` or differ: Ask the user: **Which files from the old runtime directory should be carried over to `.effective-flow/` before it is deleted?**
- Carry over all -- Copy every listed file to .effective-flow/ (do not overwrite existing files in the target)
- Select individually -- Decide per file which is carried over and which is discarded
- Carry over nothing -- Carry over no file — the entire old content is released for deletion

- **Runtime files:** If a copy needs a missing directory below `.effective-flow/`, apply
  “Runtime-state write safety” to that exact directory immediately before its `mkdir`; repeat
  this for every missing parent created. Immediately before each confirmed copy, apply the guard
  again to the concrete file target. Copy only after it passes (do not move); do **not** overwrite
  a file already present in the target. A block preserves both source and target and directs the
  user to `effective-flow setup`. Rejected items remain deletion candidates.
- **Config values:** Do **not** write differing values into the ADR yourself. Disclose them and refer to `effective-flow setup` for the carry-over. Output the affected keys concretely so the user can confirm them in `effective-flow setup`. Only once the values are in the ADR or the user explicitly discards them is the legacy `config.json` considered free of carry-over and thus deletable.
- **Labels:** no file carry-over; the carry-over happens in Phase 5 as add-`effective-flow-`-before-remove-`firmo-`.

### Phase 4: Dry-run preview

Before any deletion, list exactly what will be removed — **without** deleting yet:

1. Per artifact: path or label and the class.
2. Per file/directory, the Git status: **tracked**, **untracked**, or **gitignored**. Tracked ones are recoverable via the Git history; untracked/gitignored artifacts (`.effective-flow/`, `.firmo/`, `.sf-plugin/` are gitignored) are **not** recoverable via Git.
3. Warn on a dirty working tree and recommend committing/stashing first, so that a `git rm` staging is clean.
4. For each legacy remnant, demonstrate that its new counterpart exists and the carry-over is complete or deliberately discarded. If the new counterpart is missing (e.g. `.effective-flow/` does not exist because the migration has not run yet), do **not** offer this remnant for deletion: report that and point out that a normal tool run triggers the migration to `.effective-flow/`.
5. **Couple nested classes:** A legacy `config.json` lies physically **inside** a runtime directory (e.g. `.firmo/config.json` in `.firmo/`). Do **not** offer the containing runtime directory (class "Runtime directories") for deletion while the contained legacy `config.json` (class "Legacy `config.json`") still has open carry-over — otherwise deleting the directory would take the not-yet-carried-over `config.json` with it. Only once its values are in the ADR or explicitly discarded is the containing directory also considered deletable.

### Phase 5: Confirm deletion and execute git-aware

Obtain confirmation **per artifact class** and only then execute the deletion.

Ask the user: **Remove the legacy remnants listed above now? Tracked files via `git rm` (recoverable via the history); untracked/gitignored directories are removed physically and irreversibly.**
- Yes, remove as listed -- Tracked via git rm (staged, no commit); untracked/gitignored deleted physically; firmo labels detached from the issue
- Remove tracked only -- Only the git-recoverable, tracked artifacts via git rm; keep untracked directories and labels for now
- Cancel -- Delete nothing; the inventory remains

Execute per class:

- **Tracked files:** remove via `git rm` (staged, **no** commit). For untracked/gitignored, `git rm` does not apply.
- **Untracked/gitignored directories** (`.firmo/`, `.sf-plugin/`, a gitignored legacy `config.json`): remove physically — only after the explicit "irreversible" confirmation above, without a backup.
- **`.gitignore`:** leave every line untouched. Report the exact outdated entries and route the
  user to `effective-flow setup`, the sole owner of normalization and repair.
- **`firmo-` labels:** only in remote mode with a successful helper probe. Build the full normalized label transitions through the remote helper: first add `effective-flow-<x>` on the issue, **then** detach `firmo-<x>` (add-new before remove-old, so an abort leaves no issue unclassified). The label **definition** in the tracker remains. Inspect the dry-run steps before applying; if a step fails, report the completed steps and preserve the still-classified issue.

On any error (e.g. `git rm` fails, tracker unreachable), abort in a controlled manner: report the partial state and delete nothing whose new counterpart is not secured.

### Phase 6: Completion

Report to the user:

- what was carried over (files to `.effective-flow/`) and which config values were referred to `effective-flow setup`
- what was deleted, separated into tracked (via `git rm`, staged) and physically removed
- which outdated `.gitignore` lines remain and that `effective-flow setup` owns their repair
- which `firmo-` labels were detached from how many issues (or that the label class was skipped)
- what deliberately remains and why
- that **no** commit was created; refer to `effective-flow commit` for the staged changes

## Rules

- Never delete without a dry run and explicit confirmation.
- Do not delete any artifact before its new counterpart exists and the carry-over is complete or deliberately discarded.
- Do not delete a runtime directory while it contains a legacy `config.json` with open carry-over; only after carry-over into the ADR or deliberate discard is it deletable.
- Do not touch `.effective-flow/` (the active directory) or the project setup ADR, nor a global skill installation.
- Do not create commits or backup directories.
- Do not write config yourself; config carry-over runs through `effective-flow setup`.
- Never edit `.gitignore`; inventory and report outdated entries and route repair to
  `effective-flow setup`.
- For label cleanup, first add `effective-flow-`, then detach `firmo-` from the issue; the label definition remains.
- If no legacy remnant is present, the run is a no-op.
- Output paths relative to the project root.
