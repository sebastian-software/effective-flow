# Effective Flow Open Plans

You list open implementation plans from `<plan.dir>/`.

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default
`docs/plan`).

## Goal

- find all plan files with a canonical open status — both `**Planungsstatus:** Nicht umgesetzt` and `**Plan status:** Not implemented`
- output a short, helpful summary per open plan
- do not report plans with a missing or unclear status as open; instead report them separately as "status unclear"
- do not modify any files
- do not run tests, builds, or validations

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

## Plan status convention

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project-setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default
`docs/plan`).

Plan files in `<plan.dir>/` use exactly one canonical status marker in their header. The marker may be written in either German or English:

- open (German): `**Planungsstatus:** Nicht umgesetzt`
- completed (German): `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt`
- open (English): `**Plan status:** Not implemented`
- completed (English): `**Plan status:** Implemented`

Both marker forms are equivalent. Only one language is used per plan file. The marker is not an
independent language choice: it is part of the complete plan language resolved by "Language
resolution" (`language.workflow` for a new plan, or the preserved language of an existing plan).

### Canonical bilingual plan contract

Readers map these complete forms to the same internal meanings; writers choose one column and
use it consistently throughout the artifact:

| Meaning              | German                                              | English                                      |

| Review summary       | `### Zusammenfassung`                               | `### Summary`                                |
| Plan-review findings | `### Befunde`                                       | `### Findings`                               |
| Open points          | `## Offene Punkte`                                  | `## Open points`                             |

| Review findings      | `## Review-Befunde`                                 | `## Review findings`                         |

Tables and finding prose follow the same rule. Plan file tables use `Datei` / `Beschreibung`
and review scorecards use `Bereich` / `Kritisch` / `Wichtig` / `Hinweis` in German; English uses
`File` / `Description` and `Area` / `Critical` / `Important` / `Note`. Review dates, reviewer
labels, summary statuses, and no-findings prose are likewise rendered wholly in the plan
language. Machine-stable values called out below are the only exceptions.

Workflow routing values and skill references remain stable: `Feature`, `Bugfix`, `Refactoring`,
`Documentation`, and the referenced `effective-flow build`/`effective-flow fix`/`effective-flow refactor`/
`effective-flow docs` token are not translated. Doc-category values and target paths likewise remain
`user-guide`, `developer-guide`, `operations`, `runbooks`, and their stable paths.

Rules:

- The status marker must be written exactly as in the four canonical examples above, including bold, colon, and the capitalization of the marker keys and values.
- The plan status only applies when exactly one line with the prefix `**Planungsstatus:**` or `**Plan status:**` is present. Multiple status lines (even in different languages) make the plan status unclear (see below) and should be corrected.
- The only valid value pairs are the four key-value combinations listed above. Mixed forms of a German key and an English value or vice versa (e.g. `**Plan status:** Umgesetzt`) are **not** considered valid.
- Other values such as `Open`/`Done`, `Pending`/`Complete`, or arbitrary free text do not count either.
- Other occurrences of „Nicht umgesetzt“, „Umgesetzt“, "Not implemented", or "Implemented" in review findings, ADR rationales, or body text do not count as a plan status.
- If the marker is missing, occurs multiple times, contains an invalid value, or uses a mixed form of key and value language, the plan status is unclear. In that case, do not automatically treat the plan as open or completed.
- A writer must not combine fields or sections from both columns. A mixed plan is unclear and is
  not automatically rewritten. A requested translation converts the complete plan contract.
- When a workflow sets the status to completed, the complete plan language is preserved: a German marker becomes `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt`, an English marker becomes `**Plan status:** Implemented`.

## Approach

1. Check whether `<plan.dir>/` exists.
2. Read all Markdown files at the top level of `<plan.dir>/` in lexicographic order (date-slug names thereby sort chronologically). Exclude `<plan.dir>/archive/`.
3. Determine each file's plan status via the canonical single-marker rule of the Plan status convention: exactly one line with the prefix `**Planungsstatus:**` or `**Plan status:**` and a valid value.
4. Classify (both marker languages are equivalent):
   - **Open:** exactly `**Planungsstatus:** Nicht umgesetzt` or `**Plan status:** Not implemented`
   - **Completed:** exactly `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt` or `**Plan status:** Implemented`
   - **Status unclear:** no status line, multiple status lines, or a different value
5. For open plans, determine:
   - the title from the first H1 line (for migrated legacy plans including the number preserved there, e.g. `# 0030: Title`)
   - the path
   - the recommended workflow from `**Empfohlener Workflow:** ...` or
     `**Recommended workflow:** ...`
   - for doc plans additionally the doc category from `**Doku-Kategorie:** ...` or
     `**Doc category:** ...`, if present
   - a short summary from `## Anforderung` or `## Requirement`
   - optionally the most important affected files from `## Betroffene Dateien` or
     `## Affected files`, if short enough
6. Output:
   - If open plans exist: a table with `Plan`, `Title`, `Workflow`, `Category`, `Path`, `Summary`
     - for non-doc plans, show a dash in the `Category` column
     - for doc plans without a matching doc-category line, show `unknown`
   - Then a short list of status-unclear plans, if present
   - If multiple plan files carry the same date-slug name, point this out separately (this duplicate violates the `Plan file convention` and should be resolved via the appropriate workflow)
   - If no open plans exist: a clear message "No open plans found."

## Summary rules

- Summarize the requirement in one sentence.
- Prefer the first substantive paragraph under `## Anforderung` or `## Requirement`.
- If the section is missing, use the H1 title as a fallback.
- Remove pure meta sentences like "Verified code context:" from the summary.
- Shorten long summaries to about 160 characters.
- Do not invent content that is not in the plan file.

## Rules

- Do not modify any files.
- Do not start any implementation or validation.
- Do not count review-finding statuses like `Not implemented` or `Not implemented` as a plan status.
- Output paths relative to the project root.
- If `<plan.dir>/` is missing or contains no Markdown files, report that briefly.
