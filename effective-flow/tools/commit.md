## Portable worker delegation

Names matching `effective-flow-<worker>` in this instruction identify bundled worker contracts, not installed custom-agent roles. When a worker is selected, read only its matching `workers/effective-flow-<worker>.md` file, then delegate through the host harness's built-in general-purpose subagent mechanism with that contract as the worker instructions. Do not request a custom role by the contract name. If built-in subagent delegation is unavailable, stop with a clear explanation; never claim that an undiscoverable worker ran.

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to effective-flow setup. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers (effective-flow setup, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.
- **`delivery.prReview`** → the literal string `ask` (default), `always`, or `off`; it governs the
  automatic PR review publication after a delivery. No `delivery.prReview` line → default `ask`,
  per the rule above.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Merge-gate keys (`mergeGate.*`) and their legacy namespace

effective-flow merge-gate reads the keys below; effective-flow iterate reads the `bots` entries for its
review-in-flight guard. A missing line means the default, per the encoding rule above.

| Key                              | Values                             | Default   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `mergeGate.completion`           | `ask`, `merge`, `report`           | `ask`     |
| `mergeGate.requireAllChecks`     | `true`, `false`                    | `true`    |
| `mergeGate.checkWaitMinutes`     | positive integer                   | `20`      |
| `mergeGate.maxRounds`            | positive integer                   | `3`       |
| `mergeGate.botWaitMinutes`       | positive integer                   | `10`      |
| `mergeGate.bots`                 | comma list of logins               | `(empty)` |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` | literal trigger comment text       | unset     |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check`   | commit-status or check-run context | unset     |

A login containing brackets (`greptileai[bot]`) is a valid middle segment, because the encoding
splits on `.` only.

**Backcompat (one generation):** these keys were formerly named `prReview.*`. Where a
`mergeGate.<key>` line is absent, read `prReview.<key>` and use its value; report **once per run**
that the legacy namespace was read and that effective-flow setup migrates it. Precedence is per key: a
present `mergeGate.<key>` always wins over a present `prReview.<key>`, and the two namespaces are
never merged at a finer grain than the individual key. Reading is all this fallback does — only
effective-flow setup writes configuration, and it rewrites a legacy block in place (carry the values
over, remove the old rows, report a shadowed key). Once every project has run effective-flow setup once,
the fallback has no remaining reader and is removable rather than load-bearing.

**`delivery.prReview` is not part of this block** and is never migrated: it decides whether a run
publishes **its own review findings** onto a pull request it created (see the encoding rule above),
while `mergeGate.*` configures the gate that takes an **existing** pull request from open to merged.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, effective-flow setup may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, effective-flow setup may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in effective-flow setup.

Outside effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to effective-flow setup.

## Goal

- commit only files that are already staged
- choose a clear, descriptive Conventional Commit message
- write the human-readable commit description/body in resolved `language.git`; keep the
  Conventional Commit type and all machine tokens stable in English/ASCII
- do not run project validation such as linting, tests, or build checks

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

## Commit message rules

- Resolve `language.git` through the shared language rule and write the human-readable subject
  description and body in that language. Preserve a valid user-supplied message. Conventional
  Commit types, optional scopes, `!`, trailer keys, issue references, and other machine tokens
  remain English/ASCII. This rule also governs Conventional Commit PR-title descriptions and
  explicitly generated changelog/release-note prose.
- **Never set `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commit messages**, regardless of whether an LLM (Claude, Codex, GPT, …) or another tool suggests the line or inserts it as a default.
- If a `Co-Authored-By` line is already present in a commit template, `commit.template`, a `--trailer` invocation, or a draft message: remove it before committing.
- **Do not add AI attribution:** no „Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers and no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) in commit messages – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex remain allowed, generation attribution does not.
- Avoid generic messages like `update files` or `misc changes`.
- Describe concretely what was changed and why.
- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Choose the commit type by **effect**, not by file type: behavior-changing changes – including pure **config/env/secrets/CI** with deployment or runtime effect (e.g. corrected values in env/secret artifacts that take effect remotely via sync) – are `fix:` (or `feat:` for new functionality). `chore:` only for **deploy-neutral** changes without behavioral effect (pure maintenance, formatting, tooling without runtime effect). This also applies to the **squash PR title**, which determines the release-please bump on a squash merge.
- Do not expose internal tracking IDs in commit messages, e.g. review finding IDs like `R-0000001`, local plan/review IDs like `F1`, or placeholders like `[Finding-ID]`. Such IDs belong in wisdom/report context, not in the Git history.

## Project conventions

If the project has an `AGENTS.md`, read it before committing and follow its guidance on commit style, scope, way of working, and project-wide conventions.

## Approach

1. Check whether there are staged changes.
2. Read only the staged diff and derive from it the appropriate Conventional Commit type per the commit message rules above. Short meaning of the prefixes: `feat:` (new functionality), `fix:` (bug fix), `chore:` (maintenance), `docs:` (documentation), `refactor:` (structural improvement without behavior change), `test:` (test change).
3. Write a short, concrete summary line that describes the substantive core of the staged changes.
4. Do not run any standalone project validation; linting, tests, and other quality checks are the job of other skills such as ``effective-flow-code-validator`` and ``effective-flow-test-writer``.
5. Run `git commit` for exactly these staged changes.

## Rules

- Do not invent changes that are not in the staged diff.
- Do not start project validation such as linting, tests, or build checks; that responsibility lies with other skills.
- Respect existing Husky hooks; commitlint, prettier, and lint may block the commit.
- If hooks fail, report the relevant cause briefly instead of bypassing the hooks or starting additional validation yourself.
- If the staged changes contain several unrelated topics, point out the mixed scope and suggest splitting before committing.
