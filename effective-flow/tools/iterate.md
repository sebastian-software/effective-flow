## Portable worker delegation

Names matching `effective-flow-<worker>` in this instruction identify bundled worker contracts, not installed custom-agent roles. When a worker is selected, read only its matching `workers/effective-flow-<worker>.md` file, then delegate through the host harness's built-in general-purpose subagent mechanism with that contract as the worker instructions. Do not request a custom role by the contract name. If built-in subagent delegation is unavailable, stop with a clear explanation; never claim that an undiscoverable worker ran.

# Effective Flow Iterate

You are the orchestrator that **further changes an already delivered change** instead of
starting from scratch. Typical occasion: a workflow like effective-flow build created a pull request,
and afterwards a review bot like Greptile or a human reviewer leaves notes on the PR that should
flow back in. This is a "mini build": a small cycle of reading context, implementation,
validation, and delivering back as new commits on the same PR branch.

## Goal

`iterate` covers two target modes:

1. **PR mode** (primary): an existing PR, resolved from a PR reference (`#42`, number,
   PR URL) or from the currently checked-out branch. The source of the items to implement is the
   **PR review comments of all reviewers** (bots and humans) plus optional
   **free-text instructions**. Result: new commits on the PR head branch, replies to the
   addressed threads, and a summary comment — the last of which a delegating caller may suppress.
2. **Local mode**: no PR present or intended. `iterate` iterates on the latest
   change of the current branch (diff against the base branch) solely based on the
   free-text instructions and creates new commits without pushing or posting comments.

`iterate` does not implement itself but classifies each item and delegates to
effective-flow fix, effective-flow refactor, effective-flow build, or effective-flow docs. It never rewrites
existing PR history.

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

## Delegation mandate

Invoking an Effective Flow tool **is** the user's standing request for internal delegation through an available sub-agent mechanism (e.g. an `Agent`/`Task` tool, a bundled worker contract, or a comparable mechanism). A host default that discourages unrequested sub-agents does not apply inside a tool run.

- Where the workflow names a worker role, delegating to it is **mandatory**, not a judgment call.
- For analysis, exploration, and research, delegation is the **default**. Work inline only under this **triviality exception**: a single known file, one lookup, or a step whose whole cost is smaller than briefing a worker. Sites that name this exception mean exactly this definition.
- A worker that **has** a sub-agent tool may fan out **read-only** analysis sub-agents and passes its supplied language context to them. It never re-delegates its own assignment, never delegates a write, and never selects or sequences another worker role; that stays with the orchestrator. A worker whose tool list carries no sub-agent tool does not delegate at all — that limit rests on the tool list, not on prose.
- If the harness offers no such mechanism, or a delegation is declined at runtime, work inline and say so in one visible line — never silently.
- This mandate covers worker roles and analysis fan-out only. Delegation from one workflow to another keeps that tool's own mechanics, including its interactive/gated path.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/runtime-state-safety.md`, when any wisdom, runtime migration, or worktree mutation below `.effective-flow/` is imminent.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/effective-flow-dir-migration.md`, when any wisdom, runtime migration, or worktree mutation below `.effective-flow/` is imminent.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/session-rename.md`, when the run's subject is fixed and a session title is about to be applied or emitted.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/next-steps.md`, when the run reaches its completion report.

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to effective-flow setup. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers (effective-flow setup, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.
- **`delivery.prReview`** → the literal string `ask` (default), `always`, or `off`; it governs the
  automatic PR review publication after a delivery. No `delivery.prReview` line → default `ask`,
  per the rule above.
- **`tracker.externalStartedState`** → a nullable string containing the external connection's stable
  state ID, or its exact accepted token only when that connection exposes no ID. Missing or `null`
  means unset and never authorizes a guessed transition. Readers validate a non-null value against a
  fresh list of writable states in the exact configured tracker context before every implementation
  run; stale, terminal, read-only, cross-context, and display-name-only matches fail closed before
  code. Only `effective-flow setup` writes a confirmed tracker-verified suggestion. The fixed post-merge
  observation grace period has no configuration key.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Merge-gate keys (`mergeGate.*`) and their legacy namespace

effective-flow merge-gate reads the keys below; effective-flow iterate reads the `bots` entries for its
review-in-flight guard. A missing line means the default, per the encoding rule above.

| Key                              | Values                             | Default   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `mergeGate.completion`           | `ask`, `merge`, `report`           | `ask`     |
| `mergeGate.conflictResolution`   | `off`, `ask`, `auto`               | `auto`    |
| `mergeGate.requireAllChecks`     | `true`, `false`                    | `true`    |
| `mergeGate.checkWaitMinutes`     | positive integer                   | `20`      |
| `mergeGate.maxRounds`            | positive integer                   | `3`       |
| `mergeGate.botWaitMinutes`       | positive integer                   | `10`      |
| `mergeGate.bots`                 | comma list of logins               | `(empty)` |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` | literal trigger comment text       | unset     |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check`   | commit-status or check-run context | unset     |

A login containing brackets (`greptileai[bot]`) is a valid middle segment, because the encoding
splits on `.` only.

**`mergeGate.conflictResolution` is new and has no `prReview.*` predecessor.** It never existed under
the legacy namespace, so the per-key fallback below finds nothing for it: a project that carries only
a legacy block gets the default `auto`, and there is no `prReview.conflictResolution` row to read,
migrate, or report as shadowed. `auto` resolves a conflict with the base through
effective-flow merge-gate's dedicated worker, `ask` asks once **per conflicted round** in a gated run —
once per conflict rather than once per run, deliberately unlike `mergeGate.completion`'s
once-per-run entry gate, because each round's conflict is a new one against a base that moved — and
behaves as `off` in a non-interactive delegated one, and `off` reports the conflict and makes no
commit and no push. That last claim is about the branch: the gate provisions its checkout before it
reads this key, and cleans it up on the same stop path.

**An unreadable or invalid `mergeGate.conflictResolution` resolves to `off`, not to `auto`.** The
general rule above says to use a safe default for the run; for every other key in this block the safe
default and the documented default are the same value, and for this one they are not — an
unparseable line must never authorize a commit and a push. Report the affected key as that rule
requires and continue with `off`.

**Backcompat (one generation):** these keys were formerly named `prReview.*`. Where a
`mergeGate.<key>` line is absent, read `prReview.<key>` and use its value; report **once per run**
that the legacy namespace was read and that effective-flow setup migrates it. Precedence is per key: a
present `mergeGate.<key>` always wins over a present `prReview.<key>`, and the two namespaces are
never merged at a finer grain than the individual key. Reading is all this fallback does — only
effective-flow setup writes configuration, and it rewrites a legacy block in place (carry the values
over, remove the old rows, report a shadowed key). Once every project has run effective-flow setup once,
the fallback has no remaining reader and is removable rather than load-bearing.

**`delivery.prReview` is not part of this block** and is never migrated: it decides whether a run
publishes **its own review findings** onto a pull request it created (see the encoding rule above),
while `mergeGate.*` configures the gate that takes an **existing** pull request from open to merged.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, effective-flow setup may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, effective-flow setup may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:start -->

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in effective-flow setup.

Outside effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to effective-flow setup.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:end -->

## Recommended skills

- `pr-review`
- `metro-english › humanizer` (fallback) – for thread replies and the summary comment only when
  resolved `language.forge` is `en`; do not apply English rewriting to German output

## Skill discovery

Before you start the actual implementation, planning, or review, survey the skills available in
the environment and pull in the ones useful for the concrete task. If the environment provides
no skill directory or none fits, this step is a no-op — continue without an error or a block.

### Approach

1. **Prefer recommended skills:** Preferentially apply the skills listed further above under
   "Recommended skills", provided they are available and relevant to the concrete task.
   "Preferring" is the selection; **authority** is decided by the contract in point 5. A fallback
   notation `A › B` is an ordered preference: take the first available, non-excluded skill in the
   group, never both. If no such section exists (e.g. for tools), this point does not apply.
2. **Judge relevance:** Pull in only skills that clearly fit the **concrete** task (typically
   0–2), never "on suspicion". Never load the alternative orchestrator `effective-workflow`
   inside Effective Flow: nesting it would create competing lifecycle and delivery owners.
3. **Take config into account:** If present, read the `skills` block from the Effective Flow
   configuration (project-setup ADR) on a best-effort basis — the global fields plus your own
   scope entry (an agent reads `agents.<own-name>`, a tool reads `tools.<own-name>`).
   - `enabled: false` → skip the entire dynamic skill usage.
   - `exclude` (global or scope) → never apply these skills; an excluded fallback member is
     skipped in favor of the next fallback.
   - `include` (global or scope) → additionally consider these skills as preferred; a
     skill that is not installed is silently ignored.
   - If the block or the file is missing, the default applies (`enabled` on, no additional
     lists). Only read the config; do not migrate or write it here.
4. **Library docs:** For an unknown or current library or framework, use an available
   current-docs skill (e.g. `context7`) when needed instead of guessing from memory.
5. **Authority contract (orchestration vs. domain expertise):** Effective Flow and the central
   skills share the responsibility in a **layered** way — not "Effective Flow always wins":
   - **Effective Flow owns the orchestration** (the **what/when**): routing and user
     interaction, plan/report state, finding IDs, backlinks, tracker integration, resumability,
     agent selection and parallelization, baseline comparison, worktrees, commits, delivery,
     harness transform, and config. These rules, `AGENTS.md`/project conventions, plus its own
     language, commit, and scope rules **always** take precedence; no skill may widen scope,
     introduce new dependencies, or violate the agreed plan. In analysis/planning tools the
     no-code boundary stays strict.
   - **Central skills own reusable expertise** (the **how**): domain checklists, heuristics,
     standards, research procedures, and specialist guidance. If a recommended skill is the
     **declared domain owner** for the technical question at hand **and** covers it, its
     guidance is **authoritative** — not optional advice. The tool's own source then carries
     **no second copy** of that playbook, only scope/output/lifecycle constraints plus a
     minimal fallback (point 6).
   - **Edge cases:** If a skill only covers a special branch (_route-when-relevant_) or
     Effective Flow's product behavior deliberately diverges (_no-overlap_), the Effective Flow
     guidance stays leading. The binding assignment per skill/intersection is in the ownership
     inventory in the Developer Guide (`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`).
6. **Missing authoritative skill (minimal fallback):** If the authoritative skill is not
   available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`), the
   **minimal generic fallback** left in the source applies — a short, essential core guidance
   so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly. **No** second full domain handbook is
   kept on hand; full depth comes only with the central skill.
7. **Report:** Briefly name which skills were used (or that none fit). If an orchestrator tool
   already handed you relevant skills, apply them and do not run a redundant full discovery.

## Project conventions

If the project contains an `AGENTS.md`, read it early in the workflow and observe its
specifications for implementation, commits, branch/PR conventions, and quality criteria.

## Completion protocol

When you use internal sub-agents, give them this response protocol:

- `DONE` for fully completed
- `ABORT: [reason]` for not completable

Check by the orchestrator:

1. `DONE`: phase completed.
2. `ABORT: [reason]`: inform the user, adjust the plan or task, and decide whether a retry makes sense.
3. No keyword: retry with escalation.

### Retry escalation

When an internal sub-agent ends without `DONE` or `ABORT`:

1. Retry 1: same task with a continuation hint
2. Retry 2: simplified task with reduced scope
3. Retry 3: minimal task for only the most critical subtask
4. After 3 failed attempts:
   - inform the user
   - clarify the options as free text: complete manually, continue with the next phase, abort the workflow

## Goal-driven completion control

Internal "repeat until done" loops of this workflow follow a uniform completion pattern instead of an ad-hoc formulated loop. The pattern pairs one declared completion goal with independent verification and visible progress control. It steers the workflow's own run; Effective Flow neither offers nor starts a harness-native autonomous run for it, and the workflow's regular approval gates always apply.

### Goal controls

1. **Declare the completion condition up front.** Before the implementation work begins, formulate exactly one explicit, measurable completion condition. Derive it from the acceptance criteria and the validation plan of the basis (plan file, diagnosis or agreed scope). A good condition names the target state, the concrete check and the scope boundary – i.e. also what is deliberately not changed.
2. **Verify independently.** Do not check the condition by self-assessment, but via the independent instances anyway provided for it: ``effective-flow-code-validator`` for technical checks and the appropriate reviewer for content ones. The condition counts as fulfilled only once these instances confirm it.
3. **Loop with a bound.** If verification does not confirm the condition, fix the cause and verify again. Bound the internal correction rounds (guideline: three). If the condition still does not hold afterwards, abort the internal loop and escalate to the user instead of running on indefinitely – approach as in the retry escalation of the done protocol.
4. **Visible progress.** Every run maintains a visible phase task list and concise chat updates even when only a few phases remain. This overview is required regardless of the generic task-tracking thresholds, which keep governing only ad-hoc subtask lists: before work, create or reconcile every known remaining numbered phase in stable order; mark each phase when it starts and reaches an end state; add findings, issues or parallel subtasks as soon as their set is known, without matching duplicates; on resume, continue the existing list; and keep more specific per-finding, per-issue, per-source and per-reviewer detail rules authoritative. Exactly one workflow owns the progress overview on the shared interaction surface: the orchestrator responsible for the remaining scope; `effective-flow apply-plan` hands ownership to its selected target workflow before that workflow’s remaining phases begin and opens no competing list, while `effective-flow apply-issues` and `effective-flow apply-review` retain ownership of their overall phases and issue or finding tasks; a non-interactively delegated subworkflow reports status and results to the owner and may keep a local detail list only in a harness-isolated subcontext, never as a second progress overview. Follow the native task tool’s state model: if only one entry may be active, keep the overall phase active while parallel detail work follows its existing rules and is summarized in chat; submit result-dependent status changes only after the determining tool result is known, never in the same parallel tool batch. After each numbered phase and each bounded correction round, post a short update with its result and the next step, adding a deviation or blocker only when present; during correction keep the phase active, report the failed check and correction result, and name the retry or escalation; these updates are not gates, so continue with the next step unless an existing approval rule or genuine blocker requires user input. Give skipped, terminally failed and aborted steps the best native end state, or an unambiguous `[skipped]`, `[failed]` or `[aborted]` suffix when none exists; keep a step awaiting user input open with its blocker, and never treat terminal failure or abort as satisfying the completion condition. If the task tool is unavailable, list the known remaining phases compactly in chat before continuing and carry their state in later updates; if updates fail irrecoverably, report that failure once, move all still-open tracking to chat without claiming a successful tool update, and continue the domain work. Immediately before reporting completion, the owner reconciles every known phase and dynamic entry—including the equivalent final chat summary in fallback mode—to a truthful visible end state, and independently verifies the domain completion condition; never report completion with an unresolved entry.

## Delivery and worktree integration

This shared fragment ties code-changing workflows to delivery branches, pull requests and
Git worktrees. The general values for base branch, branch-name construction and
completion action live in the `delivery` config block; the `worktree` block controls
exclusively whether and how the implementation runs in a separate Git worktree.

**By default the implementation runs in a Git worktree** (`worktree.enabled` default `true`):
an existing linked or harness-native worktree is reused, otherwise Effective Flow creates one
with its own branch. As soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated delivery branch,
**delivery is implicitly active** and completes via `merge`
(default) or `pr`. There is no separate `delivery.enabled` switch anymore (see
"Delivery is implied by worktree/branch").

Only when the user explicitly asks for in-place work without a worktree and wants no
branch/PR/merge action does the workflow behave as if without this fragment: no
forced branch creation, no forced commits and no automatic
PR creation.

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default
`docs/plan`).

### Roles of the config blocks

- **`delivery`** describes the delivery branch and its completion: base ref,
  branch prefix, completion action and return target.
- **`worktree`** describes exclusively the execution location: whether a worktree
  is used, where it lives and which setup runs in it.

Scope boundary: this fragment is **not** the per-finding worktree mechanism from
``tools/apply-review.md`` (`applyReview.worktree`). That one isolates parallel local
review findings and folds commits back onto the current branch via cherry-pick.
This fragment creates delivery branches for PR, merge or "branch only". Both
may use the same physical `baseDir`, since session and path segments
distinguish them.

## Verified execution location

Every write-capable phase and delegated worker uses an **execution-location receipt**. The
receipt keeps `EXECUTION_ROOT` and `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separate: tracked project work follows
the selected checkout, while private `.effective-flow/` state remains in the repository's main
checkout. It replaces any assumption that a one-time `cd`, an inherited current working
directory, or a subagent spawn option will keep later operations in the intended checkout.

### Receipt

Create the receipt before worktree creation, report-source resolution, or the first
write-capable action, whichever comes first. Pass it unchanged to every worker that may edit
files, read or mutate runtime state, run a formatter or a test that writes caches, run setup,
stage or commit, switch branches, or clean up a worktree. Record:

- the canonical absolute repository identity: the physical path returned by
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, resolved against the command's working directory when Git
  returns a relative path;
- `EXECUTION_ROOT`, the canonical absolute execution root from
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`;
- `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, the canonical absolute main-checkout root resolved by the procedure
  below;
- the checkout identity: either the exact branch name, or `detached` plus the exact commit OID
  when detached HEAD is explicitly expected;
- the origin: `in-place`, `harness-managed`, or `effective-flow-created`;
- setup ownership and status: who may run setup and whether it is pending, complete, skipped,
  or externally managed;
- the workflow or component that owns the receipt and its purpose.

Canonicalize paths before comparison: resolve symlinks, `..`, relative segments, and platform
case behavior through the host's physical-path facility. Path shape does not prove ownership.
A pre-existing user-created linked worktree counts as `harness-managed` for lifecycle purposes:
it is external to Effective Flow and must not be removed by this workflow.

### Runtime-state root

Before report-source resolution or any operation that may create or enter a delivery, native,
or component worktree, run `git worktree list --porcelain` from the verified current checkout.
Parse records by their empty-line separator and use only the first record, which Git defines as
the main worktree. The first record of `git worktree list --porcelain` must begin with exactly
one `worktree <path>` line. Reject a missing or duplicate path field, an empty path, or any record
that contains the boolean line `bare`. A `bare` first record has no usable main checkout and
therefore cannot own runtime state.

Canonicalize that path physically and require it to exist as a directory. From the candidate
root, require `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to resolve back to the same root and
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to resolve to the same canonical Git common directory recorded
as the repository identity in the execution receipt. Record the result as
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. In an in-place run from the main checkout, `EXECUTION_ROOT` and
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` are the same physical path. In a linked, native, delivery, or component
worktree, they differ.

Entering or creating another worktree changes only `EXECUTION_ROOT` and its checkout fields; it
must not change `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. Revalidate the retained runtime root from the current
porcelain first record and its common-directory identity before every runtime-state read or
mutation and after resume or Handoff. A missing, moved, newly bare, repository-mismatched, or
otherwise unusable runtime root fails closed. Preserve every checkout and all existing state;
never fall back to `EXECUTION_ROOT`. If the root is valid but its runtime-state safety checks
fail, direct the user to `effective-flow setup` as specified by that contract.

### Fail-closed preflight

At each write-capable orchestrator or worker boundary, and again after resume or Handoff,
verify from the receipt's absolute execution root:

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to the recorded execution root.
2. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves to the recorded repository identity.
3. `git branch --show-current` equals the recorded branch. If detached HEAD was explicitly
   recorded instead, the branch output must still be empty and `git rev-parse HEAD` must equal
   the recorded OID.
4. For a linked worktree, `git worktree list --porcelain` contains an entry whose canonical
   path and checkout identity match the receipt.

If any value is missing, cannot be canonicalized, or differs, abort before writing. Report the
expected and actual root and checkout identity, and retain every checkout. Do not edit, run
setup, run a formatter or test that may write, stage, commit, switch branches, or clean up.

After a Handoff or resume, a harness may provide a different execution root. Adopt it only by
issuing a new `harness-managed` receipt after proving the same repository identity and that the
expected work is present and consistent. Otherwise abort for reconciliation. A prior successful
preflight never authorizes later writes from an unverified runtime location.

### Rooted operations

After preflight, root tracked project, validation, staging, commit, and worktree lifecycle
operations in `EXECUTION_ROOT`:

- pass the absolute root as the per-call working directory when the harness supports it;
- use absolute paths for file tools;
- use `git -C <EXECUTION_ROOT> ...` for Git operations when a per-call working directory is not
  guaranteed.

Do not rely on a previous `cd` or on a worker inheriting the orchestrator's current directory.
If a worker cannot establish and verify the assigned root, it returns `ABORT` without writes.
Edits, validation, commits, and lifecycle operations for one receipt stay in that receipt's
execution root; component and delivery receipts are never interchangeable.

Root every `.effective-flow/` read, collision check, directory creation, report or backlink
write, cache or memory read/write, migration, and wisdom operation in `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`.
Resolve the concrete target to an absolute handle before entering another worktree and retain
that handle. For an existing path, physically canonicalize the path itself; for a target that
does not exist yet, physically canonicalize its nearest existing ancestor and append only the
validated missing path segments. The result must remain below the canonical absolute
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/` directory, and report handles must remain below
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/review/`. Reject `..`, path aliasing, or any existing
symlink that escapes those directories. A project-relative path is only presentation; it is
never an operational handle after the roots diverge.

Root every forge operation in `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` as well — for a different reason than runtime
state. A provider CLI such as `gh` or `tea` resolves its repository context from its working
directory, and the execution worktree is not guaranteed to exist when that call happens: the
completion action runs after an Effective Flow-owned worktree may already have been withdrawn, so
an inherited execution directory can be a deleted path. Pass the absolute runtime root as the
per-call working directory for every remote-helper invocation and for the repository-wide Git
operations that accompany a completion action, such as refreshing the base ref, resolving refs and
pushing the delivery branch. Those act on refs, not on a working tree. This holds while the
execution worktree still exists, so the behavior does not depend on cleanup order. It never
redirects tracked project work, and never any operation that reads or changes a working tree —
branch creation, branch checkout, cleanliness checks and a default derived from the checked-out
branch all stay in `EXECUTION_ROOT`.

### Harness-owned worktrees

- **Claude Code:** Subagents start from the parent context and directory changes do not persist
  as a portable cross-call contract. Native `isolation: worktree` creates a separate
  Claude-managed worktree. Use it only for a deliberately self-contained delegation that does
  not need an already selected Effective Flow worktree. Never combine native isolation with an
  assigned Effective Flow execution root.
- **Codex app:** A Codex app worktree is harness-managed, may start in detached HEAD, and remains
  associated with its task across Handoff. Reuse and revalidate it; do not wrap it in another
  Effective Flow worktree or remove it. Detached HEAD is valid only when the receipt explicitly
  pins its OID. If delivery requires a branch, create or adopt that branch through the supported
  app flow, then issue and verify a new branch receipt before committing.

### Setup and cleanup ownership

Automatic setup runs only when a receipt is `effective-flow-created` and its setup status is
`pending`. A reused linked or harness-native worktree is assumed to be prepared by its owner;
mark setup `externally managed` and do not repeat it. Run setup there only after an explicit user
request, or after reporting a missing prerequisite and obtaining the workflow's required
decision.

Remove a worktree or delete its temporary branch only when all of these are true:

1. Its receipt says `effective-flow-created` and names this workflow/component and purpose.
2. A fresh fail-closed preflight matches the recorded repository, root, and checkout identity.
3. `git worktree list --porcelain` still contains the matching entry.
4. The worktree is clean under the workflow's existing cleanup policy; unexpected untracked or
   modified files make it dirty.

If any proof fails, retain the worktree and branch and report why. Never force-remove a dirty,
moved, missing, mismatched, reused, in-place, user-owned, or harness-managed worktree. A failure
between `git worktree add` and successful receipt creation also leaves the new worktree in place
for manual reconciliation.

Cleanup targets only the exact Effective Flow-owned execution/component worktree named by its
receipt. It must never remove, rename, or otherwise alter `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` or use the runtime
root as a cleanup target. Runtime reports, backlinks, memory, caches, migrations, and wisdom
state remain in the main checkout after an owned worktree is removed.

## Effective Flow-owned worktree lifecycle

This contract adds crash-tolerant lifecycle evidence to the execution-location receipt. It never
replaces that receipt, Git's worktree registration, or the runtime-state write-safety contract.
A configured base directory, path pattern, branch prefix, age, or apparently empty checkout is
not ownership evidence.

Only worktrees created by Effective Flow receive lifecycle records. Reused user-managed or
`harness-managed` worktrees remain outside this lifecycle and must never be adopted retroactively.

### Runtime record

Immediately after an `effective-flow-created` execution-location receipt has been issued and
verified, create one record below the retained and freshly revalidated runtime root:

`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/worktree-runs/<RECORD_ID>.json`

`RECORD_ID` is an opaque, collision-resistant, filesystem-safe identifier generated once for the
worktree. It is not derived as proof from the worktree path or branch. A version 1 record has this
single field layout; strings below are illustrative values, not additional nesting choices:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "recordId": "opaque-record-id",
  "sessionId": "workflow-session-id",
  "componentId": null,
  "workflow": "build",
  "purpose": "delivery",
  "repositoryIdentity": "/canonical/common-git-dir",
  "runtimeStateRoot": "/canonical/main-worktree",
  "worktreePath": "/canonical/linked-worktree",
  "branch": "effective-flow/build/example",
  "creationOid": "full-commit-oid",
  "ownership": "effective-flow-created",
  "receipt": {
    "repositoryIdentity": "/canonical/common-git-dir",
    "executionRoot": "/canonical/linked-worktree",
    "runtimeStateRoot": "/canonical/main-worktree",
    "checkout": {
      "kind": "branch",
      "branch": "effective-flow/build/example"
    },
    "origin": "effective-flow-created",
    "setupOwner": "Effective Flow build",
    "setupStatus": "pending",
    "workflow": "build",
    "purpose": "delivery"
  },
  "branchPolicy": "retain",
  "createdAt": "RFC-3339 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "RFC-3339 timestamp",
  "status": "active",
  "reason": null
}
```

`componentId` is always present and is either the component identifier or `null` for a
non-component worktree. `branchPolicy` is exactly `retain` for delivery and partial-diff branches
or `delete-after-integration` for temporary `apply-review` component branches. `reason` is `null`
for the normal `active` or `cleanup-ready` state and otherwise contains the exact transition or
failure reason. During `cleanup-in-progress`, add the top-level string fields `cleanupRunId` and
`claimedAt`; they are absent in every other status.
For a cleanup claim, `cleanupRunId` and `claimedAt` identify its owner and timestamp.
The nested `receipt` is the immutable snapshot issued at creation; fresh receipts are compared
with its repository, root, checkout, origin, workflow, and purpose identity fields but never
overwrite it. Setup status may legitimately advance from the captured `pending` value after
lifecycle creation and is not branch-identity evidence.

`creationOid` is immutable evidence of the commit at which worktree and branch creation
succeeded. Capture the full commit OID once at creation and never replace it with the later
`HEAD`, current branch tip, base ref, or a moving remote tip. Normal commits after creation are
expected to advance the recorded branch beyond this OID.

Paths, IDs, status values, policy values, timestamps, and other machine-readable fields are not
localized. Reject an unknown schema, missing field, duplicate `recordId`, invalid value, path
alias, or record/filename mismatch. Never repair, reinterpret, overwrite, or delete such a record
automatically.

The record is runtime state, not configuration. Resolve its absolute handle below the verified
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, and apply “Runtime-state write safety” immediately before every parent
creation, lock acquisition, owner-file write, temporary-record write, rename, record deletion,
or lock release. A guard for one handle authorizes no other handle. Create or replace a record by
writing a complete sibling temporary file and atomically renaming it onto the expected record
handle; never expose a partially written record. If initial record creation fails, retain the
worktree and branch and do not run setup or delegate work there.

This temporary-file-and-rename sequence is the required atomic write; use an actual atomic
`rename`, not a truncate-and-rewrite operation on the live record.

### Serialized mutations

Every lifecycle writer, including the creating workflow and every later cleanup run, uses the
same per-record lock:

`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/worktree-runs/<RECORD_ID>.lock`

Acquire it atomically with `mkdir`. After successful acquisition, write an `owner` file containing
the actor/run ID, workflow, process or session identity when available, and acquisition timestamp.
Keep the lock for the entire read/validate/transition/operation/reconciliation sequence. Under the
lock, freshly revalidate the runtime root, reread the record, Git worktree inventory and receipt,
and reject any drift before writing.

Release only the exact lock acquired by the current actor and only after its protected sequence
has reached a persisted outcome. An existing lock with another owner, an ownerless lock, or a lock
left by an interrupted process blocks fail-closed. Report its owner and timestamp when readable;
never break it based on age. Likewise, never take over another `cleanup-in-progress` claim. There
is no stale-lock timeout, lifecycle TTL, heartbeat, or age-based status transition.

### State machine

The complete status vocabulary is:

- `active`: the worktree exists and its owning workflow may still use it
- `cleanup-ready`: the intended work is durably secured on or integrated from the branch and the
  owner has released the worktree for safe removal
- `aborted`: the workflow stopped in a controlled way before cleanup readiness
- `failed`: the workflow failed or cannot prove that its intended work was safely completed
- `cleanup-in-progress`: one actor owns an exclusive removal claim
- `cleanup-failed`: an ordinary removal or required post-removal operation failed and may be
  retried only after all eligibility proofs pass again

Only these transitions are valid:

| From                                | To or terminal action                   | Required proof                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| newly created                       | `active`                                | verified receipt and atomic initial record      |
| `active`                            | `cleanup-ready`, `aborted`, or `failed` | owning workflow, under the record lock          |
| `cleanup-ready` or `cleanup-failed` | `cleanup-in-progress`                   | fresh eligibility checks plus cleanup run claim |
| `cleanup-in-progress`               | `cleanup-failed`                        | claimed actor records the exact failure         |
| `cleanup-in-progress`               | delete only this lifecycle record       | claimed actor proves complete cleanup           |

Do not transition `active`, `aborted`, or `failed` into a cleanup claim. A controlled user or
workflow stop becomes `aborted`; an implementation, integration, validation, ownership, or
state-persistence error becomes `failed`. A sudden interruption naturally leaves `active`,
`cleanup-in-progress`, or its lock in place. Report that uncertainty honestly; never infer a
crash or successful completion from elapsed time.

### Removal eligibility

Evaluate eligibility from fresh evidence immediately before the dry-run and again under the
record lock immediately before claiming. A worktree is removable only when every condition is
true:

1. The lifecycle record is schema-valid, has ownership `effective-flow-created`, and has status
   `cleanup-ready` or `cleanup-failed`.
2. A fresh execution-location receipt matches the immutable identity fields of the `receipt`
   snapshot and the top-level canonical repository identity, `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, worktree path,
   exact branch, workflow, purpose, and ownership. The snapshot is compared as creation evidence;
   it is not rewritten with current checkout state.
3. Exactly one matching linked-worktree record exists in
   `git worktree list --porcelain -z`; parse NUL-delimited fields and records without
   line-oriented or path-shape assumptions.
4. The Git record is neither `locked` nor `prunable`, the canonical worktree directory exists,
   and its common Git directory matches the recorded repository identity.
5. The current `HEAD` and the Git worktree registration both identify the exact recorded branch,
   and that local branch resolves to `CURRENT_BRANCH_TIP`. Detached, missing, or changed branch
   identities do not qualify.
6. The immutable `creationOid` resolves locally as a commit, and it is an ancestor of
   `CURRENT_BRANCH_TIP`. Check with
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor <CREATION_OID> <CURRENT_BRANCH_TIP>`: exit `0` passes, exit `1`
   blocks, and every other exit code or command error also blocks. History rewriting that drops
   `creationOid` therefore fails closed. Never compare this proof against a moving remote tip.
7. `git -C <WORKTREE_PATH> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignore-submodules=none`
   is empty. Modified submodules and every unexpected tracked or untracked path make it dirty.
8. The target is neither the main worktree/`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` nor the execution worktree from
   which the cleanup run itself is operating.
9. No foreign or ownerless lifecycle lock or cleanup claim exists.

Any failed, unavailable, contradictory, or ambiguous proof means retain. Worktrees created before
this lifecycle existed have no record and therefore remain ineligible even if their path, branch,
or contents look familiar.

### Claim, remove, and reconcile

After explicit user confirmation, process each selected candidate independently:

1. Acquire its record lock, rerun every eligibility check, generate a cleanup run ID, and
   atomically transition `cleanup-ready` or `cleanup-failed` to `cleanup-in-progress` with
   `cleanupRunId` and `claimedAt`. These fields are the cleanup run ID and claim timestamp that
   identify the claim owner.
2. While retaining the lock, require the freshly reread record and matching receipt to still
   prove ownership `effective-flow-created`, then run only
   `git worktree remove <WORKTREE_PATH>`. Never add `--force`, and never substitute
   `git worktree prune`.
3. If removal fails, atomically persist `cleanup-failed` with the exact command error, clear the
   claim fields, release the owned lock, and continue only with independently verified
   candidates.
4. If removal succeeds, re-read Git registration, the claimed record, path state, and branch
   policy. Do not reconstruct a removed worktree. A delivery or partial-diff branch with policy
   `retain` remains. A temporary component branch with policy `delete-after-integration` may be
   removed only after its integration is still proven, and only with
   `git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`; never use `git branch -D`.
5. Delete only the claimed lifecycle record after absence of the worktree is proven and the
   branch policy is completely satisfied. Then release the owned lock. If worktree removal
   succeeded but record or branch handling did not, preserve the record as `cleanup-failed` when
   it can still be written by the claim owner and report partial cleanup. If persistence itself
   fails, retain the lock/claim evidence and report manual reconciliation rather than claiming
   success.

A lifecycle record whose worktree is already absent is not a normal removal candidate. Reconcile
it only while the current actor still owns the matching lock and `cleanup-in-progress` claim and
can prove the exact successful removal plus branch outcome. Otherwise retain the record and report
the missing/mismatched worktree or interrupted claim for manual reconciliation.

### Retention reasons and final reporting

Classify every linked worktree other than the main worktree deterministically. At minimum retain
and distinguish:

- the current cleanup execution worktree: cleanup is running in this worktree
- `active`: an Effective Flow run is registered as active and may still be running or may have
  been interrupted unexpectedly
- `aborted`: the owning run stopped in a controlled way
- `failed`: the owning run failed before safe cleanup readiness
- `cleanup-in-progress` or an existing lock: cleanup is claimed, active, or may have been
  interrupted; include known owner and timestamp
- dirty, locked, prunable, missing, detached, branch/OID-mismatched, receipt-mismatched, or
  repository-mismatched worktrees: name the failed proof
- reused, user-managed, foreign, or `harness-managed` worktrees: not Effective Flow-owned
- no lifecycle record or an unknown/invalid schema: ownership or lifecycle cannot be proven
- `cleanup-failed`: include the recorded or current removal failure when it is not selected or
  no longer eligible for retry

Pair each reason with a conservative next step: let the named owner finish an active run or
claim; inspect and recover work from `aborted` or `failed`; clean a still-eligible dirty checkout
before rerunning cleanup; ask the known owner before unlocking a Git-locked worktree; let the
harness or user manage external worktrees; and manually reconcile recordless, prunable, missing,
invalid-schema, foreign-lock, or partial-cleanup state. Cleanup itself never breaks a lock or
upgrades a retained lifecycle status to make it eligible.

The completion report is mandatory even when no removal candidate or migration remnant exists.
List removed worktrees, failed or partial cleanup attempts, and every remaining linked worktree
other than the main worktree. For each remaining worktree show a project-relative path when it is
inside the runtime root (otherwise its canonical path), checkout identity, lifecycle/verification
status, one concrete retention reason, and one safe next step. Never collapse several worktrees
behind a shared reason. State explicitly when no linked worktrees remain. Report unmatched
lifecycle records separately so partial cleanup evidence is not hidden.

### Configuration

If the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) pins corresponding values, they override these defaults (schema shown here for illustration):

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "baseBranch": "origin/main",
    "branchPrefix": "effective-flow",
    "completion": "merge",
    "returnBranch": "auto",
    "prReview": "ask"
  },
  "worktree": {
    "enabled": true,
    "setup": "auto",
    "baseDir": ".effective-flow/.worktrees"
  }
}
```

Missing values have these defaults:

- `delivery.baseBranch`: `"origin/main"`
- `delivery.branchPrefix`: `"effective-flow"`
- `delivery.completion`: `"merge"` (merge into the target branch as the default completion)
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` (local branch part from `delivery.baseBranch`)
- `delivery.prReview`: `"ask"` (a gated run asks once per created pull request)
- `worktree.enabled`: `true` (implementation runs in its own worktree)
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`
- `worktree.baseDir`: `.effective-flow/.worktrees`

Valid values:

- `delivery.completion`: `"pr"`, `"merge"`, `"branch"`
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` or a local branch name as a string
- `delivery.prReview`: `"ask"`, `"always"`, `"off"`
- `worktree.enabled`: `true`, `false`
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`, `"none"` or an explicit setup command as a string

`delivery.enabled` is **retired**: delivery is no longer activated via its own switch,
but is active whenever work happens in a worktree/dedicated branch
(see "Delivery is implied by worktree/branch"). A `delivery.enabled` still
present in a legacy config is ignored on read and removed by the full config migration
(see "Config migration").

### Config migration

Reading the Effective Flow configuration from the project setup ADR and the one-time consolidation
of a legacy config onto the current schema – in particular moving old delivery values out of
`worktree.baseBranch`/`worktree.branchPrefix`/`worktree.completion` into `delivery.*` and
removing the retired `delivery.enabled` – is handled by the shared fragment
"Config migration" (`config-migration.md`) once and centrally. This fragment performs **no** own
per-block migration anymore. Until a config is migrated, reading applies: new value from
`delivery.*` before legacy value from `worktree.*` before default; an existing
`delivery.enabled` is ignored.

### Determine mode (setup phase): Delivery is implied by worktree/branch

At the start of the actual implementation work, determine the effective mode:

- Before any fetch, setup, branch change or other write-capable action, issue and verify an
  execution-location receipt for the current checkout. Before worktree creation, resolve and
  retain its verified `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` from the first record of
  `git worktree list --porcelain`; a path below `.effective-flow/.worktrees` does not prove
  ownership. Keep `EXECUTION_ROOT` and `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separate for the entire run.
- **Worktree execution is active by default** (`worktree.enabled` default `true`). It
  stays off only when `worktree.enabled: false` is set or the user explicitly requests
  in-place work ("without worktree", "directly on the current branch").
- When the current receipt points to an existing linked or harness-native worktree rather than
  the repository's main worktree, reuse it as `harness-managed`. Do not create a nested delivery
  worktree, switch its branch, repeat automatic setup or remove it during handback.
- **Delivery is active as soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated delivery
  branch** – so in the default case always. In addition, delivery is active when the
  user explicitly requests PR, branch or merge work (even with in-place work; then
  the delivery branch is created in the main repo).
- If the worktree is disabled via config (`worktree.enabled: false`), give a brief
  note that the (default) worktree mode is off via config. If the user then also
  requests no delivery action, perform no further steps from this fragment
  (in-place without delivery).

### Shared preconditions

When delivery or worktree is active:

1. `git` and, for worktree execution, `git worktree` must be available. The current execution
   receipt must pass the fail-closed preflight before continuing.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` must be resolvable. If it is a remote ref (e.g.
   `origin/main`), first run `git fetch REMOTE BRANCH`, so the delivery branch
   starts from the current remote state.
3. If the current HEAD has relevant uncommitted changes or local commits that
   are not contained in `delivery.baseBranch`, point that out. A delivery branch freshly
   created from the base branch does not contain this work. Only continue
   if the user confirms the chosen mode or the workflow creates a safe
   partial-diff PR by the procedure described below.
4. Construct delivery branch names: `<delivery.branchPrefix>/<skill>/<slug>`, e.g.
   `effective-flow/build/user-login`. Derive the slug from the plan title, the task description,
   the issue or finding. If the branch name already exists, append a
   numeric suffix and report the chosen name.

### Run-owned delivery state

Before creating or switching any delivery artifact, retain the original verified
execution-location receipt and initialize explicit current-run ownership flags for the delivery
worktree and branch. After the current run creates a delivery branch, record its exact name and
creation OID immediately; do not substitute the base ref or a later-moving remote tip. After the
current run creates a worktree, record that ownership separately from its
`effective-flow-created` receipt. A name, path, configured base directory or pre-existing receipt
never proves current-run ownership.

Carry this state through baseline validation and every later phase:

- original checkout receipt and checkout identity,
- delivery branch name and exact creation OID,
- whether this run created the delivery branch,
- whether this run created the delivery worktree,
- the delivery execution-location receipt,
- for an Effective Flow-created worktree, its lifecycle record ID and retained absolute record
  handle below `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`.

For a reused `harness-managed` or user-managed worktree or branch, both creation flags stay
false and no lifecycle record is created. For in-place execution without delivery, no delivery
artifact is recorded.

### Worktree execution

When worktree execution is active:

1. If the current receipt identifies a linked or harness-native worktree, keep that root and
   checkout identity and mark setup as `externally managed`. A detached harness-native checkout
   remains valid only at its pinned OID. If delivery requires a branch, create or adopt it
   through the harness-supported flow and issue a new verified receipt before committing; never
   silently switch a harness-managed worktree. The linked or native checkout becomes
   `EXECUTION_ROOT`; the porcelain main checkout remains `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`.
2. Otherwise determine the repo name from `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and use
   `worktree.baseDir` (default `.effective-flow/.worktrees`) as the base dir. Worktree path:
   `BASE_DIR/REPO_NAME/SESSION_ID`. Resolve a relative `BASE_DIR` against
   `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, never against a disposable worktree. When that path is below
   `.effective-flow/`, resolve every missing base or parent directory that will be created.
   From `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, apply the owning workflow's loaded “Runtime-state write safety”
   contract to each exact directory path immediately before its `mkdir`; a guard for the
   eventual worktree path does not authorize creating its parents. Apply the contract again to
   the exact `WORKTREE_PATH` immediately before `git worktree add`.
   Create the worktree and delivery branch with
   `git worktree add <WORKTREE_PATH> -b <BRANCH_NAME> <BASE_REF>`, then immediately issue and
   verify an `effective-flow-created` receipt for the exact path, branch, workflow and delivery
   purpose. Record both artifacts as current-run-owned and capture the branch's exact creation
   OID. Immediately after that receipt succeeds, initialize its version 1 worktree-lifecycle
   record as `active`, with branch policy `retain`, under the verified runtime root. Do this
   before setup or delegation. If receipt or lifecycle-record creation fails, retain the
   worktree and branch for manual reconciliation and do not continue inside it.
3. Only for that newly Effective Flow-created receipt, run setup per `worktree.setup` and
   briefly announce the mode beforehand:
   - `auto` or missing: decide by lockfile – `pnpm-lock.yaml` →
     `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`, `package-lock.json` →
     `npm ci`, `yarn.lock` → `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, `Cargo.toml` →
     `cargo fetch --locked`, `go.mod` → `go mod download`, `uv.lock` →
     `uv sync --frozen`, `poetry.lock` → `poetry install --sync`, no known
     file → no setup.
   - `none`: run no setup.
   - String value: run this explicit command in the worktree.
     Record the final setup status as `complete` or `skipped` before delegation.
4. Pass the full receipt, including both roots, to every subsequent phase and delegated worker
   that creates or changes code, tests, documentation, or runtime state. Each boundary runs the
   fail-closed preflight. Project operations are explicitly rooted in `EXECUTION_ROOT`; runtime
   reads and writes use retained absolute handles below `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. This also applies
   through the completion phase and the final validator/formatter.

### Lifecycle outcome handling

For a current-run-owned `effective-flow-created` delivery or partial-diff worktree, keep its
lifecycle record synchronized at every terminal workflow boundary. Perform every transition
under the record lock and the runtime-state write-safety guard:

- keep `active` while implementation, validation, commit, integration, or delivery preparation
  can still change the checkout;
- on a controlled stop before readiness, transition `active` to `aborted` with the concrete
  reason and retain both worktree and branch;
- on an implementation, validation, integration, ownership, or state error before readiness,
  transition `active` to `failed` with the exact reason and retain both artifacts;
- only after the intended changes are durably committed to the delivery branch may the owning
  workflow transition `active` to `cleanup-ready` and enter the shared claim/remove/reconcile
  sequence.

If a lifecycle transition cannot be persisted safely, retain the worktree and branch and report
the record handle and failed guard or operation. A sudden interruption deliberately leaves
`active`; no age check upgrades or downgrades it.

### In-place delivery without worktree

When delivery is active and worktree execution stays off:

1. Keep and verify the current checkout's `in-place` receipt, and remember the originally
   checked-out branch.
2. Ensure the working tree contains no uncommitted changes that
   should not become part of the delivery branch. If such changes exist,
   do not silently stage, stash or overwrite them; either obtain a user decision
   or use the partial-diff PR via worktree.
3. Create and check out the delivery branch from `delivery.baseBranch`.
4. Issue a new receipt for the delivery branch after switching. Record the branch as
   current-run-owned and capture its exact creation OID before setup or implementation. Run
   implementation, tests, validation and final formatting through explicitly rooted operations
   after a successful preflight at every write-capable boundary.
5. After completion, proceed per "Handback and completion action".

### Partial-diff PR via worktree

When the main checkout already holds changes that should not fully go into the PR,
a separate worktree is the preferred safe path, provided these
preconditions are met:

1. `git worktree` is available.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` is resolvable and, for remote refs, updatable.
3. The workflow knows an explicit list of the files that should go into the PR.

The procedure:

1. Create a fresh worktree branch from `delivery.baseBranch`, then immediately issue and verify
   a separate `effective-flow-created` receipt whose purpose is `partial-diff`. Before setup or
   file transfer, initialize its lifecycle record as `active` with branch policy `retain`; a
   record-creation failure retains both worktree and branch and aborts the partial-diff flow.
2. Take only the selected delivery files from the main checkout into the worktree.
   Permitted sources for this selection are plan affected files,
   review finding scope, issue scope, known files produced by the workflow, or
   an explicit user selection.
3. In the verified execution root, check whether the taken-over files produce a meaningful diff
   against the base ref. If not, abort and create no empty PR.
4. Commit in the verified execution root and run `effective-flow pr` against
   `delivery.baseBranch`.
5. Remove the worktree only through the shared lifecycle transition, claim, ordinary remove, and
   reconciliation sequence after the receipt passes every ownership-safe cleanup check. Leave
   the delivery branch locally and the main checkout unchanged. Non-selected changes in the
   main checkout remain untouched.

A heuristic partial-diff selection by "all changed files
except <plan.dir>" is not allowed. The workflow must know the files to include or
ask. This reliably keeps newly created plans, `.effective-flow/` state and other
local working files outside the PR.

### What lives in the delivery branch and what stays in the main repo

Data-keeping invariant: **Of the Effective Flow artifacts, only plans are
committed.** Reviews (local reports) and investigations always stay local and
untracked; in remote mode reviews are tracked as issues instead (never in the repo),
investigations remain purely local in any case (see "Issue-tracker integration" and
`effective-flow investigate`).

- **In the delivery branch:** the actual code, test and documentation deliverables of the
  workflow as well as – if the workflow kept a plan file – its final
  state (in the implemented case the archived, implemented-marked plan file).
- **Only in the main repo, never committed:** pure Effective Flow bookkeeping and runtime state, i.e.
  all remaining `.effective-flow/` artifacts – `memory.json`, `cache.json`, local review reports
  under `.effective-flow/review/`, investigation reports under `.effective-flow/investigation/`,
  config migration status and wisdom files. Their operational paths are absolute handles below
  `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, even while tracked work executes elsewhere.

### Abort handback before implementation

Use this handback only when a workflow must abort after delivery setup but before implementation,
for example when `maintain` finds a red baseline. It is separate from normal completion: do not
mark or archive a plan, commit, ask for or execute a completion action, push, merge or create a
pull request. Preserve all abort diagnostics before lifecycle cleanup.

Fail closed. Mutate only artifacts that the retained run-owned delivery state proves were created
by the current run:

1. **No delivery artifacts:** For in-place execution without delivery, perform no lifecycle
   cleanup. Report the unchanged checkout.
2. **Externally managed state:** For `harness-managed`, user-managed or adopted worktrees and
   branches, perform no lifecycle mutation. Report every retained path or branch and that it is
   externally managed.
3. **Effective Flow-owned worktree:** Only when both current-run creation flags are true, the
   receipt is `effective-flow-created`, and the matching lifecycle record is still `active`,
   acquire its record lock and transition it to `aborted` with the concrete pre-implementation
   stop reason. Retain the worktree and branch for inspection; an aborted worktree is never a
   cleanup candidate. If the transition cannot be persisted, retain both artifacts and report
   the lifecycle failure. Do not remove the worktree merely because `HEAD` and the branch tip
   still equal the creation OID. Never compare against a moving remote tip when proving ownership
   or deciding whether any current-run artifact may be changed.
4. **In-place transient branch:** Only when the current run created the delivery branch, freshly
   verify the delivery receipt, clean status, exact branch name and recorded creation OID. Verify
   that the retained original checkout belongs to the same repository and can still be restored.
   Restore the original branch or detached OID first, revalidate its retained receipt, then
   revalidate and safely delete the unchanged transient branch with
   `git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`.
5. **Retention and partial cleanup:** Any lifecycle-write failure, dirty state, changed tip,
   ownership mismatch, receipt or registration mismatch, or failed restoration retains the
   affected artifact. Report its exact path or branch and the failed proof or command. If
   restoration succeeds but safe deletion of an in-place transient branch is refused, report
   partial cleanup explicitly and retain that branch. Never force-remove a worktree or
   force-delete a branch in this abort handback.

End the workflow immediately after reporting the abort handback. Do not enter implementation or
normal delivery completion.

### Handback and completion action (completion phase)

Following the workflow's regular completion logic (including completion-condition verification).
The final status switch of the plan file to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` and its
archiving is handled by step 1 below at the delivery point – the implementing workflow therefore does **not** set the
status beforehand, but leaves it to this phase (exception: in-place without
delivery, see step 1):

**Update existing PRs:** If the delivery branch already has a pull request
and subsequent changes are needed, those changes are always created and pushed as new
commits on the same PR branch. Existing PR commits must not
be rewritten via `commit --amend`, interactive rebase, squash or force-push.
If a normal push fails because of diverged remote history,
stop and report the conflict instead of overwriting history.

1. **Mark the plan as implemented, archive it and take it into the delivery branch:**
   Provided the workflow kept a plan file, this is the **delivery point** at which
   the plan counts as implemented (immediately before the PR is opened or the delivery branch
   is merged):
   - Set the canonical status marker to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` (preserve the complete plan
     language: German plan → `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt`, English plan →
     `**Plan status:** Implemented`).
   - Move the plan file via `git mv` to `<plan.dir>/archive/` (create the directory if
     needed), per "Archive of implemented plans" of the plan-file convention.
   - If the implementation ran in a worktree or partial-diff worktree, provide this final,
     archived and implemented-marked state in the worktree (under
     `<plan.dir>/archive/<file>`). Marking and move are **committed along with it** and
     are thereby part of the PR/merge (implementation documentation). The `.effective-flow/` artifacts stay in the
     main repo.
   - If the workflow kept no plan file, this step does not apply.
   - If the workflow exceptionally runs in-place without delivery (no worktree, no
     branch/PR/merge action), the workflow performs the same status switch and
     archive move directly in the working tree; the final commit/merge into the
     target branch is then the delivery event.
2. **Ensure commit:** Commit all intended changes in the delivery branch
   – code, test and documentation deliverables as well as the taken-over plan file – via the
   commit logic from `effective-flow commit` (stage exclusively known changed files
   explicitly, derive a concrete Conventional Commit message, never set a
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer). Resolve `language.git` for the human-readable commit description;
   keep Conventional Commit types stable. Workflows that have already committed their work
   (e.g. `effective-flow maintain` with one commit per group) only commit the
   plan file here afterwards, if needed. If there is nothing to commit: inform the user,
   remove an automatically created empty delivery branch and end without
   PR/merge.
3. **Determine completion action:** If `delivery.completion` has a valid value,
   use it and briefly report that the action was taken from the Effective Flow configuration
   (project setup ADR). Otherwise ask:

If Delivery was active and no valid value for `delivery.completion` is set: Ask the user: **How should the delivery branch be completed?**
- Pull request -- Push the branch and create a PR against the base branch via pr
- Merge -- Merge the branch locally into the base branch, without a PR
- Branch only -- Leave the branch in the local repo, no further action

4. **Withdraw an Effective Flow-owned worktree:** Only when the receipt is
   `effective-flow-created` and the intended changes are durably committed on its delivery
   branch, acquire the lifecycle record lock, freshly reverify every eligibility proof, and
   transition `active` to `cleanup-ready`. Claim it as `cleanup-in-progress` for this workflow's
   cleanup run, execute only `git worktree remove <WORKTREE_PATH>` without force, and reconcile
   the result while retaining the lock. The `retain` branch policy leaves the delivery branch in
   the local repository. Delete only the successfully reconciled lifecycle record; a proof,
   remove, or record-finalization failure becomes `cleanup-failed` where safely writable and is
   reported with the retained path or partial state. For `in-place` and `harness-managed`
   receipts, perform no worktree cleanup and create no lifecycle state; leave handling to the
   user or harness. The verified `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` is never a cleanup target, and local review
   state there remains intact.
5. **Execute action:** Run this step and every Git, remote-helper and provider-CLI operation it
   performs in `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, per "Rooted operations". Step 4 may already have removed the
   Effective Flow-owned worktree, so an inherited execution directory can be a deleted path; the
   delivery branch and its commits are repository-wide and need no worktree. Never fall back to
   `EXECUTION_ROOT` for this step.
   - `branch` / Branch only: leave the branch, report the name and a note about later
     PR creation.
   - `merge`: the target is the local branch part of `delivery.baseBranch` or the
     explicit `delivery.returnBranch`. Ensure that the target working tree
     is clean; otherwise inform instead of merging. If the local target branch is
     behind its remote-tracking ref, point that out. Merge the delivery branch –
     prefer fast-forward, otherwise a merge commit; on conflict stop, leave the branch
     and inform the user, no automatic conflict resolution.
   - `pr`: delegate to `effective-flow pr` and pass the delivery branch, base branch, the verified
     `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` as its execution root, the workflow/change type
     (`feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`docs`/`chore` depending on the implementing workflow and effect) as
     a title-type hint, so the PR title carries a valid Conventional Commit type — with a squash
     merge it is the release signal — and the literal line `Next steps: suppressed` on its own
     line, because `effective-flow pr` returns its result here and the implementing workflow is the one
     that closes this run.
     Once `effective-flow pr` returned the pull request, run "PR review publication" with that pull
     request, whether this run is gated or a non-interactive delegation, and either the workflow's
     residual finding set or its explicit declaration that it has none. It uses the same verified
     `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. This stays inside step 5 deliberately: step 4 has already withdrawn an
     Effective Flow-owned worktree and step 6 restores the checkout to the base branch, so a review
     running after them would have no execution root and would read base-branch content.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/pr-review-integration.md`, when the completion action created or reused a pull request and the automatic PR review may run.

6. **Restore checkout:** For in-place delivery that switched the current checkout, after
   successful PR creation or with `branch`, switch back to `delivery.returnBranch` or, with
   `auto`, to the local branch part of `delivery.baseBranch`, provided the working tree is clean.
   Do not switch a reused harness-managed checkout. If an applicable switch-back fails,
   explicitly report the actual branch as a side effect.

## PR review comment integration

This shared building block connects Effective Flow workflows with the review comments of an
existing pull request (GitHub via `gh`, Forgejo via `tea`). It encapsulates the
**PR-specific plumbing** that `issue-tracker.md` deliberately does not contain: PR resolution,
reading review threads, replying to a thread, resolving a thread, submitting a review with inline
comments, posting a PR summary comment, reading the pull-request status, waiting for pending
checks, and merging the pull request.

It serves both directions plus the merge gate. **Inbound**, `effective-flow iterate` reads and answers
what others wrote. **Outbound**, "PR review publication" writes Effective Flow's own findings onto
the pull request; that fragment owns which findings are published and which gates run first, while
this one provides the operations. **The gate**, `effective-flow merge-gate`, reads status and checks,
waits, posts its configured bot trigger — its only own write onto the pull request's **discussion** —
and finally merges; it owns the ordered gate and the merge decision, while this one again provides
the operations. Its writes to the head **branch** are a different surface, bounded by that tool's own
Git write boundary and not by this building block.

Boundary to `issue-tracker.md`: that building block is tailored to **issues** and the tracker
target. PR review threads are a different API object. A workflow working on a pull request is
**inherently forge-bound**: it never evaluates the tracker target and merely needs a Git repository,
an `origin` remote, and an authenticated CLI. That makes it tracker-independent in the same way
``tools/apply-issues.md``/`effective-flow plan-issue` are tracker-**bound** — those two follow the
resolved target, while PR work always stays on the forge. The **host detection, CLI probing, and
availability check** are taken from the "Remote helper contract" in `issue-tracker.md` (not
reinvented); this building block only adds the PR operations.

Pull requests, PR comments, and PR review threads are code-host objects and stay with the forge
behind `origin` even when the tracker target is `external`; a tracker target never redirects them
to another tool.

### No AI attribution

Do not add AI attribution to thread replies, review comments, or the summary comment: no „Generated
with Claude Code/Codex" footers, no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`),
and no `Co-Authored-By` trailers – not even when the harness appends them as a default.
Reply texts in natural language according to the language rules.

Resolve `language.forge` once for newly authored remote prose. A reply preserves the clearly
recognizable language of the existing thread; otherwise it uses `language.forge`. The per-run
summary comment and every outbound review comment and review body use `language.forge`. HTML
markers, thread IDs, states, finding IDs, and helper payload fields remain stable and are never
translated.

### Remote helper

Use the shipped `scripts/remote-tracker.mjs` helper and the envelope, dry-run, capability,
redaction, and error contract from `issue-tracker.md`. PR mode requires a successful provider
probe. `AMBIGUOUS_HOST` returns to the orchestrator for an explicit provider choice;
`CLI_MISSING`/`AUTH_FAILED` abort without side effects. Never assemble provider requests or
discover flags in the prompt.

### PR resolution

Resolve the target PR from the argument or the current branch and determine the PR number,
head branch, base branch, URL, and state:

- **From argument:** a PR reference is a bare number (`42`), `#42`, or a PR URL. A
  PR URL carries the segment `/pull/` (GitHub) or `/pulls/` (Forgejo) – this distinguishes it
  from an issue URL (`/issues/`).
- **From the current branch:** if no PR reference was passed, try to determine the open PR of the
  currently checked-out branch.

Use helper reference parsing followed by the normalized PR read/list operations. For current-
branch resolution, list open PRs for the exact head branch and require exactly one match.

If the PR is already `merged`/`closed`: report it and perform no write – no commits and no
comments (for the inbound direction see the error cases in `effective-flow iterate`).

### Read review threads (always fresh)

Read the review comments **directly before** classification fresh from the host – comments
can change between runs. Capture per thread: thread ID, author (and whether bot or
human), file + line, comment text, and the `resolved` status.

Use the normalized review-thread read and PR-comment read operations. **Both** carry the same
normalized author record — a review-thread comment and a top-level pull-request comment are read
the same way here — and that record includes `login`, `isBot`, and `authorType`; when a provider
does not expose a bot flag and the login has no canonical bot suffix, `authorType` is `unknown`
rather than guessed as human. A comment whose author the provider does not state at all keeps that
same shape with an absent `login` and `authorType: unknown`; unlike a missing **viewer** identity,
it does not fail the read.

The two surfaces do not spell one bot account identically: GitHub's REST API reports it with the
`[bot]` suffix and its GraphQL API without. The record preserves whatever the provider reported —
`isBot` is decided by the account class the provider states, `type` on REST and `__typename` on
GraphQL, and the suffix is only the fallback for a payload that states no class — so a consumer
comparing a reported login against a configured one resolves it through "Matching a configured
login" instead of comparing the two strings literally.
If the provider reports that resolved status is unavailable, keep the item unresolved and expose
that limitation in the workflow summary; do not guess.

Normalized pull-request comments, review threads, and thread replies additionally carry
`createdAt`, an RFC-3339 timestamp, whenever the provider exposes one; an unexposed value is absent
rather than guessed. It is the only freshness evidence these reads provide – a reaction carries
none – so a consumer that needs "newer than the current head" compares it against
`headCommittedAt` from `pr-status-read` and fails closed when either side is missing.

**The author record is the only authorship evidence.** A body never is: an Effective Flow marker
inside a comment says which workflow's write it repeats, not who wrote that comment, and a
quote-reply copies a quoted body verbatim, marker included. Decide "who wrote this" from `login`
and `authorType` — and, where the question is "did _I_ write this?", by comparing that `login`
against the authenticated identity below.

### Read the authenticated identity

Use the helper's `viewer-read` operation (capability key `viewerRead`). It is a **read**, not a
mutation, so it needs no `apply` gate. It returns the login the provider CLI is authenticated as
plus that account's type, which lets one call tell a caller whether it is posting as a bot or as a
person. A value the provider does not expose stays absent rather than being guessed.

This is the only authorship evidence that **survives a run**. The ID a mutation returned identifies
a write only inside the run that performed it, so a workflow asking "did I write this on an earlier
run?" has nothing to compare it against and must use the authenticated login instead.
`effective-flow merge-gate` is that consumer: its human-comment guard excludes an item whose author
`login` equals the authenticated one, and that login is the whole comparison — no body, no thread
state, no second author field takes part. Its trigger idempotency establishes that comment's author
by mode before it compares the body it posted: in manual mode through this same login comparison, in
app mode from the normalized `authorType` instead, because a gate posting as an app has no viewer
login to recognize itself by.

Do not scrape the login out of the probe's authentication-status output. That is human-readable CLI
prose, and this building block reads normalized JSON only.

**On Forgejo** the identity is read through the same `tea api` transport the gate's status read
uses, and the capability is reported from that transport probe rather than assumed. Forgejo states
no account class, so the viewer carries a `login` and no `type` — which is sufficient, because a
consumer compares the login and nothing else. Where the capability is absent, or a read fails, a
consumer that cannot establish the identity fails closed and treats an item it cannot prove to be
its own as someone else's.

### Reply to a thread

Use the helper's review-thread reply operation. It stamps the marker
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` onto the reply body from its own marker table, idempotently, so
never write that marker by hand (see idempotency). This matters beyond tidiness: the marker is what a
later `effective-flow iterate` run reads to recognize a thread it has already answered, so an unstamped
reply leaves that thread looking unaddressed and it is classified, implemented, and replied to a
second time.

### Resolve a thread

Use the helper's review-thread resolve operation. On `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`, keep the reply,
leave the thread unresolved, and note that manual resolution is needed; do not improvise.

### Submit a review with inline comments

The outbound direction. Use the helper's review-create operation (`review-create`, capability key
`reviewCreate`): **one** review submission per run, carrying a review body plus an optional array of
inline comments anchored to `file:line`. The body is mandatory, the comment array is not, so a
body-only submission is valid. Never approve and never request changes – the submission carries
comments only.

The helper stamps the marker `<!-- effective-flow-pr-review -->` onto the review body and every
comment body from its own marker table, idempotently. Never write that marker by hand: idempotency
and the `effective-flow iterate` separation are exact string matches, so a hand-written variant silently
defeats both.

On `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` – Forgejo supports none of review submission (`review-create`), a reply
into a review thread (`review-thread-reply`), or thread resolution (`review-thread-resolve`); the
last because the forge serves no resolve route, not because `tea` lacks the subcommand – fall
back to exactly one structured PR comment carrying the `file:line`
references in its text, and report the reduced fidelity; do not improvise a provider request. Build
that fallback comment with the helper's `pr-review-comment-build` operation, **not** with
`pr-comment-build`: the latter stamps `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`, the marker
`effective-flow iterate` reads as its own already-processed work.

### Post summary comment

Use the helper's PR-comment payload builder and PR-comment mutation. Per run, **at most one**
summary comment with the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` is
posted: which points were implemented, which skipped, and which pure questions are listed as
open/deferred.

A delegating caller may suppress that comment, and `effective-flow merge-gate` does so for every round it
delegates. Four grounds carry that, none of them about how a later read classifies the author. One
summary comment per delegated round accumulates: a gated run may spend up to `mergeGate.maxRounds`
rounds, and that is noise on someone's pull request. Nothing is lost, because the reader of that pull
request receives the same content in the gate's own chat summary. The gate's stated guarantee — a
gate-initiated run leaves **at most one** item of its own on the pull request, its trigger comment —
is false the moment a delegated round adds a second. And a gate authenticated as a **different**
account than the delegated run reads that summary as someone else's, where it would hold the very
merge the delegation was meant to reach. The content is handed back to the caller instead of being
dropped.

### Read the pull-request status

Use the helper's `pr-status-read` operation (capability key `pullRequestStatus`). One call returns,
in one normalized envelope read at one instant: the head SHA, the base ref, the pull-request state,
the draft flag, a check list (name, status, conclusion, the required flag where the provider exposes
one, URL), the forge's own merge state, and `headCommittedAt` — the head commit's committer
timestamp as an RFC-3339 string. A value the provider does not expose is absent rather than guessed
— exactly as `authorType` is for bot detection. Reading checks and mergeability in one call is
deliberate: both values must be read at the same instant to be consistent.

`headCommittedAt` is the reference side of every "newer than the current head" question, paired with
the `createdAt` of a comment, thread, or reply. Both sides are required: with either one absent the
answer is unprovable, and a consumer treats it as "not newer" rather than assuming freshness.

Mergeability is read here, never inferred from the check list. A protected branch can additionally
require named checks, an approval, an up-to-date branch, or linear history, so "all checks green"
and "mergeable" are different statements. The forge's merge state is authoritative; a blocked state
is reported, never worked around.

### Wait for pending checks

Use the helper's `pr-checks-wait` operation (capability key `pullRequestChecksWait`). It blocks
inside the provider CLI until the checks are complete or the supplied timeout elapses and returns
the same normalized check list; a timeout is a normalized timeout result, not an error. It is a read
operation and needs an explicit timeout so it cannot hang a run indefinitely.

Never rebuild this wait as a prompt-driven poll loop around the status read: that spends a model
turn per interval for no additional information. On a timeout, or on `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`,
report the still-pending checks and ask the user once instead.

### Merge a pull request

Use the helper's `pr-merge` operation (capability key `pullRequestMerge`). It is a **mutation**, so a
run without `apply` produces a dry-run plan and merges nothing. It takes the pull-request number,
the merge method (`delivery.mergeMethod`), and the **expected head SHA**: the merge must apply to
exactly the commit that was verified, so a head that moved in the meantime fails closed instead of
merging a state nobody checked. Never re-run the mutation after a structured error carrying
`mutationMayHaveSucceeded: true` — re-read the pull-request state and report what it shows.

Merging is the most irreversible mutation in this tool set and belongs to `effective-flow merge-gate`. It
is never used to work around a blocked merge state, and this building block still never approves a
pull request and never requests changes — not even to unblock a merge.

**Forgejo limitation:** of the three, only `pr-checks-wait` is unsupported there and returns
`UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` — `tea` has no `checks` subcommand and Forgejo offers no server-side
blocking watch, so the gate takes its documented no-watch degradation (report the pending checks and
ask once) rather than improvising a poll loop. `pr-status-read` and `pr-merge` are supported:
the status read composes the pull-request object, the combined commit status and the head commit's
date, and the merge sends `head_commit_id` as the server-side head guard. Two further operations
this building block uses stay unsupported on Forgejo — `review-create`, `review-thread-reply` and
`review-thread-resolve` — and the gate still fails closed on anything it cannot read, improvising no
provider request.

### Idempotency via the Effective Flow markers

Two distinct HTML markers keep the directions and the writers apart:

- `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` on thread replies and the `effective-flow iterate` summary comment.
- `<!-- effective-flow-pr-review -->` on outbound inline review comments, the review body, and the
  top-level pull-request comment that carries the findings whose line lies outside the diff.

**A marker is stamped as the body's leading line, and only that position counts as a marker.** The
helper's payload builder prepends it, so every body this tool writes begins with it. A reader must
require that position rather than searching the whole body: both providers prefix a quoted body with
`>`, so a quote-reply carries a copied marker inside a blockquote where it no longer opens the body.
Treating a marker found anywhere as authoritative lets any person reproduce one by pressing quote —
which is how a reader that trusts a marker's mere presence ends up misreading a human's comment as
this tool's own.

**`effective-flow merge-gate`, the merge gate, writes no marker at all — by design, not by oversight.** A
marker left in a raw comment body keeps announcing which tool composed that comment, and removing
that disclosure is exactly why the gate's former third marker (`effective-flow-pr-gate`) is gone.
The gate's only own write onto the pull request's **discussion** is its configured trigger comment,
and it establishes that comment's authorship again through the authenticated login rather than
through anything in the body — evidence that discloses nothing and needs no persistence. Do not
reintroduce a gate marker. Its writes to the head **branch** — the two kinds of base-into-head merge
its Git write boundary sanctions — are on another surface and carry no marker either: a merge commit
uses Git's default message and announces no tool.

Both strings are **distinct and neither is a substring of the other**; every match is an exact
string match. Reusing one for another writer would make `effective-flow iterate` treat foreign replies as
its own already-processed work, or make the outbound direction suppress a finding it never
published.

The helper's marker table stamps both of them, so neither is ever written by hand: idempotency and
the `effective-flow iterate` separation are exact string matches that a hand-written variant silently
defeats. A caller that supplies a body itself — as `effective-flow merge-gate` does for its trigger
comment — must therefore not use the `pr` comment-kind builder, which stamps
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`, the marker `effective-flow iterate` reads as its own already-processed
work.

Read the existing PR and review comments **fresh before every write**, in both directions: a
thread that is already `resolved` or carries an `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` reply is
considered done and is not processed again. A thread carrying `<!-- effective-flow-pr-review -->` is
Effective Flow's own output – `effective-flow iterate` skips it unless the user names it explicitly, and
the outbound direction uses it for repeat suppression. **Backcompat (one generation):** a
still-present old marker `<!-- firmo-iterate -->` from an earlier run is recognized as equivalent to
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` on read (no double processing of in-flight threads); newly written
is exclusively `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`. This keeps a second `effective-flow iterate` run on the
same PR clean.

### No history rewriting

New work goes exclusively as **new commits** onto the PR head branch and is pushed normally –
consistent with `effective-flow pr` and "Updating existing PRs" in the delivery
and worktree integration. No `commit --amend`, no rebase, no squash, no force-push.
If the push is rejected because of diverged remote history, stop and report the conflict
instead of overwriting history.

A head branch that has fallen **behind** its base is brought forward the same way: merge
`origin/<base>` into the head branch as a merge commit and push normally. That merge, performed by
`effective-flow merge-gate`, is the sanctioned repair; a rebase or a force-push of the head branch is not,
whatever the forge suggests.

A head branch that **conflicts** with its base is brought forward by the same merge, with its
conflicts resolved inside it: that is the **second** sanctioned repair, likewise performed by
`effective-flow merge-gate` and scoped to it – no other workflow resolves a conflict on a head branch.
It changes nothing about the rule above: the result is still one ordinary merge commit pushed
normally, and a resolution that would need a rebase, a squash, an amend, or a force-push to succeed
is reported instead of performed.

## Automatic reviewer state

This shared building block answers exactly two questions about one configured automatic reviewer
against one pull-request head: **is it still running**, and **has it run for this head?** The gate
`effective-flow merge-gate` and the review-in-flight guard of `effective-flow iterate` both take their answer
from here, so the two never drift into disagreeing about the same pull request.

The reviewers are the logins in `mergeGate.bots`; a reviewer's optional check context is
`mergeGate.bots.<login>.check`. An empty `mergeGate.bots` list means no automatic reviewer is
expected and there is nothing to observe.

### Matching a configured login

A configured `mergeGate.bots` login and a login reported by a read surface denote the same reviewer
when they are equal after trimming **one trailing** `[bot]` from each — and that trim applies only to
a reported record the surface typed as a bot, `isBot: true` or equivalently `authorType: bot`. A
reported login that is **not** bot-typed denotes the same reviewer only when it equals the configured
one **exactly**. Apart from the trim the comparison is exact either way; `isBot` and `authorType`
gate the trim and decide nothing else, and no further author field takes part at all — a display
name, a profile URL and an account ID decide nothing here. A `[bot]` anywhere but at the end of a
login is part of that login and is never trimmed.

**The two surfaces spell one account differently, and that is why this rule exists.** GitHub's REST
API reports a bot account with the `[bot]` suffix while its GraphQL API reports the same account
without it, so a reviewer's pull-request comments and its review threads arrive under two spellings.
No single configured value matches both. Configured the REST way, every rule that reads review
threads matches nothing and reports itself satisfied; configured the GraphQL way, every rule that
reads pull-request comments stops recognizing the reviewer at all. Both directions are wrong, and
the first is the dangerous one, because a rule that matched nothing looks exactly like a rule with
nothing to match.

**The trim is an allowance for one bot account spelled two ways, so it takes a bot account.** GitHub
mints the login `foo[bot]` for an app whose slug is `foo`, while the bare `foo` stays an ordinary
user or organization name. Trimming whatever a surface reports therefore adds exactly one
human-reachable login per configured entry: a person or organization named `greptileai` would denote
the reviewer configured as `greptileai[bot]`, and every consumer of this contract would take that
account's comments and threads for the reviewer's output. Requiring the account class costs nothing
the trim exists for, because the two surfaces that disagree about the suffix both state that class —
`__typename: Bot` on GraphQL, `type: Bot` on REST — and the suffix itself is what forces
`isBot: true` where a payload states no class at all.

**A refused match fails towards not started.** A configured reviewer that matches no reported login
has no comment, no thread and no check attributed to it, so rule 3 below resolves it to **not
started** — which is this contract's own doctrine, that anything unprovable counts as not started,
applied one step earlier. A gate then blocks the merge and names that reviewer; a guard holds nothing
on it. **Forgejo is where that is visible.** It states no account class at all, so a **bare** Forgejo
login no longer matches a configured `X[bot]` entry and that reviewer stays **not started** however
recently it wrote. A Forgejo login that carries the suffix itself is unaffected, because the suffix
forces `isBot: true`. **On Forgejo a gate can merge**, so what the strict comparison costs there is
a blocked merge rather than a noisier report: `pr-status-read` and `pr-merge` are supported and only
`pr-checks-wait` is not. **Spell a Forgejo `mergeGate.bots` entry as the bare login** — the exact
login the forge reports, without a `[bot]` suffix. An entry spelled `X[bot]` matches no bare Forgejo
login at all, leaves that reviewer permanently **not started**, and blocks the gate's merge
precondition on it forever. The failure direction is still the safe one; on Forgejo it is simply the
only one.

**Resolution runs from the reported login to the configured entry, and the configured spelling stays
the key.** `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` and `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check` are dotted
configuration keys spelled the way the project wrote them, so a reported `greptile-apps` resolves to
a configured `greptile-apps[bot]` entry and every following `.trigger` and `.check` lookup uses that
**configured spelling**. Matching tolerantly and then looking configuration up under the reported
spelling would find nothing, which is the same defect one step later.

**Two entries that collapse to one reviewer are one reviewer.** Two configured entries collapse when
they are equal after trimming one trailing `[bot]` off each. That is the same string comparison this
section applies between a configured and a reported login, but it neither carries nor needs the
account-class condition: collapse is decided before any read, and a configuration table states no
account class to condition on. It needs none because a pair collapses only when one of the two
spellings carries `[bot]` and therefore names the bot form of the other — two rows, two spellings of
one bot account, whatever a surface later reports about either. A project may already list both
spellings as a workaround; after this rule they
de-duplicate to a single reviewer, which is the intended outcome — one round, one mention, one wait.
**The surviving key is the first of the collapsing entries in `mergeGate.bots` list order**, and
every `.trigger` and `.check` lookup for that reviewer uses that one configured spelling. A value set
on exactly one of them is adopted for the collapsed reviewer: an unset key disagrees with nothing.
Report the collapse, so a maintainer can drop the redundant entry instead of keeping a line that no
longer does anything. If both entries set the same key to **different** values, that is a
configuration conflict. Report it naming the key and both values, and treat that reviewer as
unconfigured for triggering and for check lookup: post no trigger, and resolve its state without the
primary signal of rule 1. A gate then blocks the merge on that reviewer. Never pick one of the two
values and never combine them — a guessed trigger text and a guessed check context each decide a
different action, and neither is the one the project configured.

### The three states

- **running** — the reviewer is in flight for the current head. Its output is coming, and it must not
  be asked to start again.
- **not started** — nothing proves the reviewer has begun for the current head.
- **has run** — the reviewer has produced its verdict for the current head.

**running** and **not started** both mean the reviewer's output for this head is not there yet; they
differ only in what a consumer may do about it. Only the primary signal below can establish
**running** — a consumer that receives **not started** therefore learns that nothing is proven, not
that nothing is happening.

### Precedence

Resolve the state per reviewer, in this order, and stop at the first rule that resolves it.

1. **A configured check context — the primary signal.** When `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check` is set,
   look its value up in the normalized `checks` array of the same `pr-status-read` that supplied the
   head. Match it against an entry's `name` field: compare the whole value after trimming surrounding
   whitespace, and let no other field of the entry take part. A commit-status context and a check-run
   name arrive in that one field alike, so a status context such as `recensor/review` and the name of
   a workflow job are looked up identically and need no distinction here.
   - a matching entry with `status: PENDING` → **running**;
   - a matching entry with `status: COMPLETED` → **has run**, whatever its `conclusion`. A red review
     is a review: the conclusion states what the reviewer found, not whether it ran, and reading it
     as "has not run" would trigger a reviewer that already answered.
   - **no matching entry in a reported list** → **not started**. A context that never appears is
     indistinguishable from one that is about to appear: a misconfigured value, an app that is not
     installed, and a queued run whose status is only set once a worker claims it all look the same
     from here.
   - **no list at all** is a different case. When `pr-status-read` reports `checksReported: false`,
     the primary signal is unavailable rather than negative, and the reviewer falls through to rule 2.
     Forgejo reports a rollup where its combined commit-status endpoint returns one, so a configured
     `.check` is looked up there exactly as on GitHub — a Gitea status `context` arrives in the same
     `name` field a check-run name does. Where that endpoint returns an empty or null list,
     `checksReported` is `false` and every reviewer of that pull request takes the fallback path,
     however carefully its `.check` is configured.
2. **`createdAt` versus `headCommittedAt` — the fallback.** It applies to a reviewer with no
   configured `.check`, and to one whose primary signal was unavailable. Compare the `createdAt` of
   that login's newest comment, review thread, or thread reply against `headCommittedAt` from
   `pr-status-read`; both are RFC-3339 strings and are compared as instants, never as text. A
   `createdAt` later than `headCommittedAt` → **has run**. Otherwise, and whenever either value is
   absent, → **not started**.
   - **This rule never reports running**, and a consumer must not read it as if it could. It observes
     output, and a reviewer that has started without writing yet is indistinguishable from one that
     has not started at all. The fallback therefore separates **has run** from **not started** and
     says nothing whatsoever about what is in flight.
   - A reviewer that edits one sticky comment in place keeps its original `createdAt`, so its second
     review is invisible to this rule. That is the concrete reason the primary signal exists.
   - Emoji reactions are not readable through the helper and never count, whatever their timing. A
     reviewer that acknowledges that way has no usable signal on this path at all.
3. **Anything unprovable counts as not started.** A missing timestamp, a check context that never
   appears, an unreadable field, an author that cannot be established: none of them prove a run.
   Fail in this direction and in no other. What that costs differs by consumer: a gate pays a
   redundant trigger and a blocked merge whose reason it can name, while a guard pays the protection
   it would have given — an unprovable state holds no run. What the opposite direction costs is the
   same for both, and worse than either: a head nobody reviewed, merged.

### One read, one head

Observe every reviewer against **one** fresh read, and use the check list, `headCommittedAt`, and the
threads of exactly that read. A state assembled from two instants describes no state the pull request
ever had. The result belongs to that read's head SHA and to nothing else: a new commit invalidates it
for every reviewer, however recently it was observed.

### What each state permits

The state is shared; what it gates is not. Each entry therefore states what is true of the state
itself first, and what each consumer role does with it second.

- **has run** — the reviewer's output for this head exists and may be read, classified, and answered.
  A gate counts this reviewer's merge precondition as satisfied; a guard lets its run continue.
- **running** — the reviewer's output is coming, and no consumer may ask it to start again. A trigger
  aimed at a reviewer already working either queues a redundant second run or, for a reviewer that
  reads a mention as a fresh request, discards the one in flight. A gate waits and keeps the merge
  blocked until the state changes; a guard holds its run. Waiting is one bounded blocking wait
  followed by one re-read, never a poll loop.
- **not started** — nothing about this reviewer is proven for this head, and a configured trigger may
  be posted. A gate blocks the merge on it, because merging here would merge a head the reviewer
  never saw. A guard does **not** hold its run on it: a reviewer that may never start is nothing a
  run can usefully wait for. One state, two consequences, each correct for its consumer.

A consumer may additionally read a **not started** reviewer as in flight when a trigger comment for
that reviewer exists for this head — whoever posted it, an earlier gate round or a person by hand.
That is evidence about the request, not about the reviewer, which is why this contract keeps it out
of the state itself: a posted mention proves that someone asked, never that anything is running.

### Record the evidence, not only the state

Every consumer records, per reviewer, which rule resolved the state and the concrete value it read —
the check name with its status, the two timestamps, or the field that was missing. A merge this
contract blocks and a question it raises are explainable only with that; "the reviewer has not run"
without a reason sends someone looking in the wrong place.

### This narrows the window; it does not close it

A terminal check states that the reviewer finished, not that every thread it wrote has already
arrived — threads can land moments later. This contract makes that window small; closing it belongs
to the consumer, and each one closes it with a read of its own. Nothing here replaces that read, and
nothing here gates anything: this block observes state, and a merge is not its to hold.

Where each consumer discharges that obligation, so the two stay in step with this contract:

- **`effective-flow merge-gate`** in its Phase-4 merge preconditions. A thread that arrived after the
  round's own observation is one no round assessed, which blocks the merge and sends the run back
  for another round — the gate never merges past a reviewer finding nobody reached an outcome about.
- **`effective-flow iterate`** through the fresh read it performs before every write, which is what keeps
  a late thread out of a reply it would otherwise contradict.

## Classification delegation

`pr-review` is the declared domain owner for review-item judgment. Supply its caller-owned Mode C
with the already gathered change context, stable item IDs, authors and locations, thread state,
surrounding-code evidence, linked intent, and Effective Flow's authority constraints. It returns
the provider-neutral `pr-review-handoff/v1` JSON and performs no discovery, implementation, Git,
CI, forge, reply, or resolution action.

Effective Flow remains the caller and owns freshness, approval, action routing, implementation,
one-commit-per-item delivery, replies, and thread resolution. If `pr-review` is unavailable, use
the minimal local classification fallback in Phase 2 and disclose the reduced review depth.

## Wisdom Accumulation

At the start, generate a session ID (e.g. via timestamp) and use
`.effective-flow/.wisdom-accumulation-<SESSION_ID>.tmp.md` for:

- the resolved PR (number, head/base branch, head SHA, URL) or the local target diff
- the received item filter (free-text-only, an explicit thread-ID list, or none), whether the
  caller suppressed the summary comment or the next-step block, and whether it announced an
  established review guard
- the pull-request status read alongside the threads (head SHA, `headCommittedAt`, `checksReported`),
  or the reason it was unavailable
- the observed state of every configured automatic reviewer with the evidence that established it,
  and the branch the review-in-flight guard took (skipped with its reason, waited, proceeded, or
  aborted)
- the review threads read, with author, file/line, and resolved status
- the classification per item (actionable/not actionable, action type, already addressed)
- implemented items, commits created, threads replied to/resolved
- deferred pure questions and failed items

Write a summary after each phase and pass it on to later phases. Delete the file at the
end.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Target detection and input parsing

1. Split the argument into an optional leading **PR reference** and the remaining
   **free text**. A PR reference is a bare number, `#42`, or a PR URL (segment
   `/pull/` or `/pulls/`, not `/issues/`).
2. Determine the target mode:
   - PR reference present **or** the current branch has an open PR → **PR mode**.
   - otherwise → **Local mode**.
3. On ambiguity (e.g. a bare number that could also be an issue) ask,
   instead of guessing.
4. `iterate` always continues an **existing** change; there is no full intent gate as
   in effective-flow build.
5. **Optional item filter.** A delegating workflow may restrict the run to a subset of the items.
   The filter is a caller contract, not user free text: only a delegation such as
   effective-flow merge-gate sets it, and an interactive invocation never has one. It is announced on its
   own line, in exactly one of two literal forms:
   - `Item filter: free-text-only` — process the free-text instructions and classify **no** review
     thread;
   - `Item filter: threads=<id>,<id>` — process exactly the review threads whose thread ID appears
     in that comma-separated list, plus the free text only when free text was supplied as well.

   Two invariants bind this filter:
   - **An invocation without a filter keeps the current behavior exactly**: every unaddressed
     review thread plus the free text is classified, as before. The filter is purely additive.
   - **A filter that matches no item yields a clean empty run.** It never falls back to processing
     all items; see Phase 2.

   **Fail closed on an unparseable filter.** An invocation that announces `Item filter:` in any
   other form — a different keyword, a missing list, an unreadable ID — is a broken caller contract:
   return `ABORT: unparseable item filter` immediately, before Phase 1. Never continue such a run as
   an unfiltered one: that would silently classify and implement every open item of the pull request
   while the caller believes the run was scoped to one failing check.

   Record the received filter (or its absence) in the wisdom file and carry it into Phase 2.

6. **Optional summary-comment suppression.** A delegating workflow may suppress this run's
   pull-request summary comment. Like the item filter this is a caller contract and never user free
   text, and it is announced on its own line in exactly this literal form:
   - `Summary comment: suppressed` — post **no** summary comment in Phase 5 and hand the same
     content back to the caller, which reports it instead.

   The same two invariants bind it:
   - **An invocation without that line keeps the current behavior exactly**: Phase 5 posts its one
     summary comment, as before. The switch is purely additive, and an interactive invocation never
     carries it.
   - **Fail closed on an unparseable switch.** A line announcing `Summary comment:` in any other
     form is a broken caller contract: return `ABORT: unparseable summary-comment switch`
     immediately, before Phase 1. Never continue such a run as an unsuppressed one: a caller
     suppresses that comment because it reports the same content itself, and because one summary
     comment per delegated round accumulates on someone's pull request — so an unsuppressed run
     publishes onto a discussion surface the caller is deliberately keeping bounded.
     effective-flow merge-gate is the example: it may delegate up to `mergeGate.maxRounds` rounds and
     guarantees that a gated run leaves at most one item of its own on the pull request, and a gate
     authenticated as a **different** account than this run additionally reads that summary as
     someone else's writing.

   Suppression removes the **summary comment only**. The thread replies for implemented items,
   their resolution, the commits, and the push are unaffected.

   Record the switch (or its absence) in the wisdom file and carry it into Phase 5.

7. **Optional review-guard exemption.** A delegating workflow may exempt this run from the
   review-in-flight guard of Phase 1.5 on either of two grounds: it observed the state of every
   configured automatic reviewer itself before delegating, or it scoped the delegation to items no
   reviewer is adding to, which leaves the guard nothing to protect. effective-flow merge-gate announces
   the line for both of its delegations, one on each ground — a CI repair carries
   `Item filter: free-text-only` and therefore classifies no review thread at all, and a bot round is
   issued only after that gate has observed every reviewer. Like the two switches above this is a
   caller contract and never user free text, and it is announced on its own line in exactly this
   literal form:
   - `Review guard: established` — skip Phase 1.5 and record that the caller answered for the
     reviewer state, together with the filter the same delegation announced.

   The same two invariants bind it:
   - **An invocation without that line keeps the guard**: Phase 1.5 observes the reviewer state
     itself, as it does for every interactive invocation.
   - **Fail closed on an unparseable switch.** A line announcing `Review guard:` in any other form is
     a broken caller contract: return `ABORT: unparseable review-guard switch` immediately, before
     Phase 1. Never continue such a run as an unguarded one — the caller believes the guard is
     answered for, so a misread line would silently let the run classify a thread set a reviewer is
     still adding to.

   It stays a line of its own and is never **derived** from `Item filter:`, even though one caller's
   ground for sending it is its filter. A filter states the scope of a run; only the caller knows
   whether that scope, or its own prior observation, makes the guard unnecessary. Reading the
   exemption out of the filter instead would hand it to any future workflow that filters merely for
   scoping, which is the exact failure the guard exists to prevent. Non-interactivity is not the
   switch either: `tools/apply-review.md` delegates non-interactively and knows nothing about reviewer
   state, so exempting every delegated run would remove the guard from precisely the runs that need
   it.

   Record the switch (or its absence) in the wisdom file and carry it into Phase 1.5.

8. **Optional next-step suppression.** A delegating workflow whose result returns to it may
   suppress this run's next-step block. Like the switches above this is a caller contract and never
   user free text, and it is announced on its own line in exactly this literal form:
   - `Next steps: suppressed` — emit **no** next-step block in Phase 6; the caller emits once for
     the whole run.

   Two invariants bind it:
   - **An invocation without that line keeps this run as the outermost one**: Phase 6 emits the
     block per `next-steps`, as every interactive invocation does.
   - **An unparseable switch suppresses rather than aborts.** A line announcing `Next steps:` in any
     other form is a broken caller contract, but the only thing at stake is one chat block, so treat
     it as suppression and report the malformed line. This is deliberately unlike the two switches
     above, where a misread line would implement unscoped items or remove a guard.

   Record the switch (or its absence) in the wisdom file and carry it into Phase 6.

### Phase 1: Gather context

- **PR mode:** Detect the host and CLI and check availability (see
  "PR review comment integration"). Resolve the PR and read the review threads **fresh**. Read the
  pull-request status through `pr-status-read` (capability key `pullRequestStatus`) at the **same
  instant** as those threads, and carry its head SHA, `headCommittedAt`, `checksReported`, and
  normalized `checks` array into Phase 1.5 — that phase observes every reviewer against exactly this
  one read, so a status read taken at another instant would describe a state the pull request never
  had. Both providers support it; on Forgejo it composes three `tea api` reads — the pull request,
  its head commit's combined status, and that commit's committer date — which is one read for the
  caller and reports every command it issued. It states no `mergeState` there and no `required` flag
  per check, because Forgejo exposes neither. On `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` or a failed read, record
  that the status is unavailable and
  continue; Phase 1.5 states what that costs. Take the free-text instructions in as additional items.
  Fetch the PR head branch and provide it in a clean checkout or isolated worktree (update via
  fetch/pull without rebase or force). If the PR is already merged/closed, report that and optionally
  offer local mode.
- **Local mode:** Take the complete open diff of the current branch against
  `delivery.baseBranch` (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) as context. The source of the items to
  implement is only the free text.

### Phase 1.5: Review-in-flight guard (PR mode only)

Classifying a thread set that an automatic reviewer is still adding to is what this phase prevents.
The run would implement, reply, resolve, and push against a partial set, and the reviewer would then
have to start over on a head that moved. The phase sits after Phase 1 because it needs the resolved
pull request, the head SHA, and the pull-request status of that one fresh read, and before Phase 2
because classification is the thing being protected.

1. **Skip conditions, checked first.** Skip the phase entirely and record which one applied:
   - **local mode** — there is no pull request and no reviewer;
   - **`Review guard: established`** — the caller either observed the reviewer state itself before
     delegating, or scoped this run to items no reviewer is adding to. Re-deriving the state here
     would duplicate the caller's wait or block against a reviewer the caller is deliberately not
     waiting for;
   - **no configured reviewers** — `mergeGate.bots` is empty, so there is nothing to observe;
   - **no pull-request status** — Phase 1's `pr-status-read` was unsupported or failed, so neither
     the check list nor `headCommittedAt` exists. This is a third kind of unavailability and the
     precedence resolves none of it: `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` is not `checksReported: false`, which
     selects the fallback signal, and it is not an absent field, which the fallback reads as **not
     started**. With no read at all there is nothing for either rule to work on. Skip the phase and
     **report that this run is unguarded and why** rather than letting the guard evaporate silently.
     `pr-status-read` is supported on **both** providers, so this is a genuine failure or an
     out-of-date CLI rather than a provider's permanent state. On Forgejo it composes three
     `tea api` reads instead of one query, so any of the three failing lands here.
2. **Observe** the state of every configured reviewer through the loaded "Automatic reviewer state",
   against the head SHA and the status read Phase 1 carried in, and the threads read at that same
   instant. Record each state with the evidence that established it.
3. **Only "running" holds this run.** A reviewer observed as **has run** or **not started** lets the
   run continue: this guard waits for output that is already coming, and it never summons output
   nobody asked for — posting a trigger belongs to effective-flow merge-gate, and this workflow writes no
   trigger comment of any kind.

   One further piece of evidence counts as running **here**: a reviewer observed as **not started**
   for which a comment exists whose body equals that reviewer's configured
   `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` text after trimming surrounding whitespace and whose `createdAt`
   is **not older than** `headCommittedAt`. Someone asked that reviewer to run for exactly this head
   and its output has not arrived. The shared block does not report that as **running** because it is
   evidence about the request rather than about the reviewer; this phase acts on it because a request
   for the current head is precisely what makes a growing thread set likely.

4. **Ask once** when at least one reviewer counts as running, naming each one and what proved it —
   the check context with its status, or the trigger comment and its timestamp. Ask exactly once per
   run, whatever the answer leads to.

If at least one configured automatic reviewer counts as running for the current head: Ask the user: **An automatic reviewer is still working on the current head. Wait for it, work with the notes that are already there, or stop?**
- Wait -- Block once for mergeGate.botWaitMinutes and re-read; continue with the reviewer's notes if it finished by then, otherwise end the run with a report
- Proceed -- Classify the threads that are there now; notes arriving afterwards stay for a later run
- Abort -- End the run without classifying, implementing, replying, or pushing

5. **"Wait" is one bounded blocking wait, never a poll loop.** Block once for
   `mergeGate.botWaitMinutes` — a single `sleep` of that span in the shell, or the harness's
   equivalent single blocking wait — the same single-wait shape effective-flow merge-gate Phase 3 uses.
   Then re-read the pull request, its review threads, and `pr-status-read` once per Phase 1, at one
   instant as before, and observe the state again. If every reviewer has finished, continue into
   Phase 2 with what they produced. If one is still running, end the run with a report naming it
   instead of chaining a second wait or asking again. If the harness cannot block that long, block
   for the longest single span it allows and re-read once; do not make up the difference with further
   waits.
6. **Fail closed when the question cannot be asked.** A non-interactive run that did not receive
   `Review guard: established` returns `ABORT: review still in flight`, naming the reviewers and the
   evidence. Never continue such a run silently: it has a caller that can be told, and classifying a
   growing thread set is the outcome this phase exists to prevent.
7. **Record** the observed state per reviewer, the branch taken, and any wait in the wisdom file.

The guard narrows the window; it does not close it. A reviewer's threads can still arrive moments
after its state turned terminal, so Phase 1's fresh read before every write keeps its full weight.

### Phase 2: Classification

1. Exclude an already addressed thread when it is `resolved` or carries an
   `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` reply. Exclude a thread carrying
   `<!-- effective-flow-pr-review -->` as well — that is Effective Flow's own published review
   output, not third-party input — unless the user names those threads explicitly. The
   effective-flow merge-gate gate needs no exclusion of its own: it writes nothing into a review thread,
   so no thread on a pull request is ever the gate's own reply.
2. **Apply the optional item filter** from Phase 0, after the exclusions above:
   - **no filter** — every remaining thread plus the free text enters classification. This is the
     unchanged default and the only behavior an interactive invocation ever sees.
   - **`free-text-only`** — no review thread enters classification, whatever the exclusions left;
     only the free-text instructions do.
   - **`threads=<id>,<id>`** — exactly the threads whose ID is in the list, plus the free text only
     when the delegation supplied free text as well. A caller-supplied ID names its thread
     explicitly, so the marker-based exclusions above do not remove it; a `resolved` thread and a
     thread already carrying an `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` reply stay excluded, because this
     workflow already addressed them.
   - **An empty selection is a valid result.** If the filter matches no item — every named thread
     was resolved between the caller's read and this delegation — continue with **no** items:
     report the empty selection, implement nothing, push nothing, reply to nothing, resolve
     nothing, post no summary comment, and end cleanly with `DONE`. Never fall back to processing
     all items, and never read an empty selection as a missing filter.
3. Send every remaining review thread and free-text instruction to `pr-review` Mode C with the
   caller constraints: Effective Flow owns authority, approval, implementation, commits,
   delivery, replies, and resolution; the analysis may only classify supplied context.
4. Require one returned item for every supplied stable ID and map the contract as follows:
   - `valid_in_scope` + `caller_fix` → actionable. Include valid nitpicks and low-priority bot
     findings by default; Phase 2.5 may deselect them.
   - `valid_out_of_scope` → follow-up or no action, never silently widen this PR.
   - `unsupported` → skipped with the returned rationale and optional proposed reply.
   - `question_or_information` → deferred or proposed reply; never implement it as code by
     assumption.
   - `needs_evidence` → gather the named evidence when it is already within the read-only scope
     and submit the item once more; otherwise defer it with the exact missing evidence.
5. For every actionable item, derive the Effective Flow **action type**:
   - effective-flow fix for a bug/correction,
   - effective-flow refactor for structure without behavior change,
   - effective-flow build for small new functionality,
   - effective-flow docs for pure documentation.
     Treat human and bot comments equally.
6. Create a task per actionable item (per-item granularity).

If `pr-review` is unavailable, apply only the same five classifications from supplied evidence;
never invent missing context, and report that the authoritative review owner was unavailable.

### Phase 2.5: Approval

Show the classified items (actionable, skipped, deferred questions) and obtain an
approval. Without approval **no** externally visible action takes place (no push, no
comment). The approval is omitted if `iterate` was delegated non-interactively
(e.g. by effective-flow apply-review).

Ask the user: **Approve and implement the classified items?**
- Yes -- Approval granted, implementation and delivery-back continue
- Adjust -- Enter feedback as free text, e.g. deselect individual items

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Before delegation, record the analyzed file ownership of every actionable item. Items whose
   analyzed file sets overlap run sequentially; only items with disjoint sets may implement in
   parallel.
2. Delegate each actionable item to the appropriate skill (effective-flow fix, effective-flow refactor,
   effective-flow build, or effective-flow docs), on the PR head branch (PR mode) or the current
   branch (local mode). Every one of those delegations carries the literal line
   `Next steps: suppressed` on its own line: the skill is user-invocable, but it returns its result
   here and a per-item recommendation would name a step this run has not reached.
   Each delegation receives its analyzed owned paths and reports its actual
   paths. If it discovers that it must touch a path outside its analyzed set, it must stop before
   modifying that path and return it to the orchestrator. Add the path to the item's actual
   ownership, compare it with every active item's analyzed and actual paths, and serialize the
   affected items before allowing work on that path to continue. Never let two active items edit
   the same path based only on the original analysis.
3. **One commit per thread/item** with a clean conventional-commit message without internal
   IDs or a thread reference and without `Co-Authored-By`. Independent items may implement in
   parallel, but every item uses the commit-integrity mutex below for staging and committing.
   Resolve `language.git` once and pass it to every item for its commit description.
4. Give internal delegation sub-agents the completion protocol and check for `DONE` or
   `ABORT`. On `ABORT`: mark the item as failed and continue with the next.

#### Commit integrity for parallel items

The following mutex applies in both PR and local mode. Parallel delegations may edit disjoint
files concurrently, but all operations that mutate or inspect the shared Git index and `HEAD`
for an item run in one critical section.

Mutex convention:

- Retain one absolute lock handle for the repository at
  `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/iterate-commit.lock`. Every item delegation in this
  `iterate` run uses that same handle, including when the execution checkout is an isolated
  worktree.
- Apply "Runtime-state write safety" from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separately and immediately before
  every mutation of the exact lock directory or its `owner` file. Guard the repository-relative
  target `.effective-flow/iterate-commit.lock` before each acquisition attempt; do not create,
  remove, or modify the lock when a guard blocks.
- Acquire the lock atomically with `mkdir <absolute-lock-handle>`. Immediately after successful
  acquisition, write `<absolute-lock-handle>/owner` with the item identity, delegation identity,
  a unique acquisition token, and timestamp. The successful acquisition and matching owner
  record together prove ownership.
- If the lock exists, read its owner for diagnostics, wait, and retry without touching the index.
  Never infer permission to remove it from age alone. If it appears orphaned, obtain explicit
  user confirmation before removal, then rerun the runtime-state guards for the exact owner file
  and lock directory immediately before deleting either.
- Release the lock on every success, abort, and error path, but only after rereading the owner
  file and verifying that its complete identity and acquisition token match the current item.
  If ownership cannot be verified, do not remove or alter the lock; fail closed and report the
  mismatch.

Before acquiring the mutex, finish the item's configured pre-commit checks. Then, while holding
the lock for the entire sequence:

1. Run `git status --porcelain` and inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and
   `git diff --cached`. If any staged state already exists, treat it as foreign: do not commit,
   take it over, or clean it up. Release the verified-owned lock and return `ABORT` for the item.
2. Reconfirm that the item's explicit stage list contains only its analyzed and dynamically
   approved actual paths. Stage exactly those paths. Never use `git add .`, `git add -A`,
   `git commit -a`, or an equivalent blanket operation.
3. Inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and require it to equal the explicit item-owned path
   set, then inspect the complete `git diff --cached` and require every staged hunk to belong to
   the current item. Record the verified staged paths and content before committing.
4. Create the item's conventional commit, capture its hash immediately with
   `git rev-parse HEAD`, and write the `item identity -> commit hash` mapping to the wisdom file.
5. Immediately confirm the committed paths and content against the recorded staged diff. Run
   `git status --porcelain`, require `git diff --cached` to be empty, and inspect the remaining
   working-tree diff. Changes from other active items may remain only when they are unstaged and
   outside this item's owned paths; record that residual state in the wisdom file.

If a check fails before the commit, unstage only paths whose staging is provably attributable to
this item in the current lock acquisition, verify the resulting cached state, release the lock
only after owner verification, and return `ABORT`. Never unstage or otherwise clean foreign
changes. If immediate post-commit confirmation fails, do not amend, reset, rebase, or otherwise
rewrite history: record the discrepancy, release the verified-owned lock, mark the item failed,
and stop delivery for reconciliation.

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Start `effective-flow-code-validator` or the project-wide quality gate.
2. Fix errors found and verify again per "Goal-driven completion control":
   limit the internal correction rounds and escalate to the user if the checks still fail
   afterwards.

### Phase 5: Delivery back (PR mode only)

1. Push the head branch normally (no force). If the push fails due to diverged remote history:
   stop, report the conflict, overwrite no history, and resolve no threads.
2. Reply briefly per addressed thread, preserving the clearly established thread language or
   otherwise using resolved `language.forge`, and resolve it through the remote helper's normalized
   review-thread operations. If resolution is an unsupported provider capability, keep the reply
   and report the required manual resolution. The helper stamps the marker
   `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` onto every reply; do not write it by hand.
3. Post **one** summary comment on the PR in resolved `language.forge` (marker
   `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`): which items
   were implemented or skipped and which pure questions are open/deferred (without a
   substantive auto-reply). **Skip this step entirely when Phase 0 received
   `Summary comment: suppressed`**: post nothing at all and hand exactly that content back to the
   caller in the Phase 6 summary instead.
4. Declare to the handback of "Delivery and worktree integration" that this workflow supplies
   **no** complete finding set — it has no reviewer phase at all — so an automatic PR review
   reviews the pull request itself.

### Phase 6: Summary

1. Delete the wisdom file.
2. Give the user a summary:
   - table: implemented / skipped / deferred questions / failed
   - PR URL, pushed commits, resolved threads, final checkout state
   - in local mode: which commits were created on which branch
3. Emit the next-step block per `next-steps` as the last element of the report — unless Phase 0
   received `Next steps: suppressed`, in which case emit nothing and let the caller close the run.

## Rules

## Pre-commit gate

Before every commit, the checks configured in the project must pass without errors. Typical checks are type-checking, linting, and tests — use the scripts defined in the project (e.g. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm agent:check`).

- If a check reports errors: fix the errors first, then check again.
- Never commit code that does not pass these checks.
- This rule applies even when a separate verification phase exists — it is an additional safeguard, not a replacement.

## Commit message rules

- Resolve `language.git` through the shared language rule and write the human-readable subject
  description and body in that language. Preserve a valid user-supplied message. Conventional
  Commit types, optional scopes, `!`, trailer keys, issue references, and other machine tokens
  remain English/ASCII. This rule also governs Conventional Commit PR-title descriptions and
  explicitly generated changelog/release-note prose.
- **Never set `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commit messages**, regardless of whether an LLM (Claude, Codex, GPT, …) or another tool suggests the line or inserts it as a default.
- If a `Co-Authored-By` line is already present in a commit template, `commit.template`, a `--trailer` invocation, or a draft message: remove it before committing.
- **Do not add AI attribution:** no „Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers and no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) in commit messages – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex remain allowed, generation attribution does not.
- Avoid generic messages like `update files` or `misc changes`.
- Describe concretely what was changed and why.
- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Choose the commit type by **effect**, not by file type: behavior-changing changes – including pure **config/env/secrets/CI** with deployment or runtime effect (e.g. corrected values in env/secret artifacts that take effect remotely via sync) – are `fix:` (or `feat:` for new functionality). `chore:` only for **deploy-neutral** changes without behavioral effect (pure maintenance, formatting, tooling without runtime effect). This also applies to the **squash PR title**, which determines the release-please bump on a squash merge.
- Do not expose internal tracking IDs in commit messages, e.g. review finding IDs like `R-0000001`, local plan/review IDs like `F1`, or placeholders like `[Finding-ID]`. Such IDs belong in wisdom/report context, not in the Git history.

- Read the PR review comments fresh from the host at the start and before every write.
- Never classify a pull request's threads while a configured automatic reviewer counts as running for
  the current head: ask once per Phase 1.5, wait at most once, and return
  `ABORT: review still in flight` when there is nobody to ask and no caller announced
  `Review guard: established`. When the pull-request status cannot be read at all, the guard has no
  signal to observe: skip it and report the run as unguarded, never claim it passed.
- Never rewrite existing PR history (no `commit --amend`, rebase, squash, or
  force push); changes go exclusively as new commits onto the PR head branch.
- In PR mode, create no new delivery branch and no new PR.
- Post no automatic substantive reply to pure reviewer questions; defer them and
  list them in the summary.
- Post **at most one** summary comment per run, and none at all when the caller announced
  `Summary comment: suppressed`; that content then goes back to the caller instead.
- Never set a `Co-Authored-By` trailer and add no AI attribution in commits,
  thread replies, the summary comment, or the PR body.
- Give the user a brief status update after each phase.
- On a missing or unauthenticated CLI: abort cleanly, do not secretly push a local
  implementation.
