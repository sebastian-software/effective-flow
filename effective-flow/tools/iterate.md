## Portable worker delegation

Names matching `effective-flow-<worker>` in this instruction identify bundled worker contracts, not installed custom-agent roles. When a worker is selected, read only its matching `workers/effective-flow-<worker>.md` file, then delegate through the host harness's built-in general-purpose subagent mechanism with that contract as the worker instructions. Do not request a custom role by the contract name. If built-in subagent delegation is unavailable, stop with a clear explanation; never claim that an undiscoverable worker ran.

# Effective Flow Iterate

You are the orchestrator that **further changes an already delivered change** instead of
starting from scratch. Typical occasion: a workflow like effective-flow build created a pull request,
and afterwards a review bot like Greptile or a human reviewer leaves notes on the PR that should
flow back in. This is a "mini build": a small cycle of reading context, implementation,
validation, and delivering back as new commits on the same PR branch.

## Goal

`iterate` covers two target modes:

1. **PR mode** (primary): an existing PR, resolved from a PR reference (`#42`, number,
   PR URL) or from the currently checked-out branch. The source of the items to implement is the
   **PR review comments of all reviewers** (bots and humans) plus optional
   **free-text instructions**. Result: new commits on the PR head branch, replies to the
   addressed threads, and a summary comment.
2. **Local mode**: no PR present or intended. `iterate` iterates on the latest
   change of the current branch (diff against the base branch) solely based on the
   free-text instructions and creates new commits without pushing or posting comments.

`iterate` does not implement itself but classifies each item and delegates to
effective-flow fix, effective-flow refactor, effective-flow build, or effective-flow docs. It never rewrites
existing PR history.

## Language resolution

Effective Flow resolves the language of persisted, human-readable content by **target surface**.
The project setup ADR may contain these stable keys; each value is `de` or `en`:

| Key                                | Surface                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language.project`                 | Fallback for every surface; default `en`                                    |
| `language.source`                  | Comments, test descriptions, and in-code documentation                      |
| `language.documentation.user`      | Root README, marketing entry point, and user documentation                  |
| `language.documentation.technical` | Developer/API documentation, operations documentation, runbooks, and ADRs   |
| `language.workflow`                | Plans, plan reviews, local review reports, and investigation reports        |
| `language.forge`                   | Issues, PR bodies, issue/PR comments, and remote review replies             |
| `language.git`                     | Commit descriptions, Conventional Commit PR titles, changelog/release prose |

Identifiers, public API names, config keys, encoded values, schemas, paths, label names, HTML
markers, finding IDs, action values, Conventional Commit types, and branch slugs are not
localized. Product UI/CLI/error text follows the target project's product-i18n rules and is not
controlled by this configuration. Exact quotations and incoming third-party text are not
translated unless explicitly requested.

### Resolver (the single precedence rule)

For each artifact, determine its target surface first and resolve exactly once:

1. An explicit user language request for that artifact wins.
2. When editing an existing artifact, preserve its clearly recognizable language unless the user
   requests translation. If it is mixed or unclear, clarify before changing human-readable prose.
3. For a new artifact, use the valid surface-specific `language.*` override.
4. Otherwise use a valid `language.project`.
5. Otherwise use `en`.

Only `de` and `en` are valid. An invalid value has no special meaning: report the affected key,
ignore it, and continue with the next fallback. A missing override means inheritance; `null` is
not a language value. Interactive, non-persisted replies follow the user's current language,
using `language.project` only if the conversation language is not recognizable.

At overlap boundaries, the publication destination decides: local review prose uses
`language.workflow`, remote review prose uses `language.forge`, commit prose uses `language.git`.
A PR title that is a Conventional Commit subject uses `language.git`; its body and all comments
use `language.forge`.

An orchestrating tool resolves every required surface once per run and passes the concrete
`de`/`en` values to delegated agents. Agents must use that supplied language context and must not
independently re-read the project setup ADR. A directly invoked agent or standalone tool with no
orchestrator resolves the required values itself using this same rule.

### Transitional workflow fallback (read compatibility only)

When no valid `language.workflow` and no valid `language.project` exist, a legacy
`plan.markerLanguage = de|en` may temporarily supply `language.workflow`; report that the old
marker setting now controls the **whole workflow artifact** and point to `effective-flow setup`.
Writers never create `plan.markerLanguage`.

If no `language.*` or legacy marker key exists, an unconfigured project may temporarily derive
`language.workflow` from its existing plan corpus only when the plan prose, canonical fields,
and status marker consistently and unambiguously use one language across the corpus. A marker
alone is not evidence. Mixed, contradictory, empty, or unclear corpora supply no signal and fall
through to `en`; report the setup recommendation. This fallback is read-only compatibility and
does not authorize rewriting existing plans.

### Complete artifact consistency

One persisted artifact uses one language for all human-readable prose, including its headings,
field labels, displayed status values, review sections, and open-point sections. Readers accept
the documented complete German and English forms; writers never mix them. An explicit translation
changes the complete artifact, not only one marker or heading.

### Typography

Map `de` to `de-DE` and `en` to `en-US`. Locale-specific typography of visible prose — quotation
marks, dashes, umlauts and ß, non-breaking spaces, number and date formats — is owned by the
central `locale-typography` skill. Its locale guidance is authoritative; Effective Flow keeps no
second typography checklist.

If the skill is unavailable (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`),
use only this minimal fallback for German prose: real umlauts and ß rather than ASCII
transliterations, German quotation marks „…“, and a spaced en dash – for parenthetical dashes.
Do not alter code, identifiers, commands, paths, or machine-readable values for typography.

## Task tracking

When there are several tasks to complete, use an available TODO or task-tracking tool (e.g. `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, `TodoWrite`, or a comparable tool) to create a task list. Set each task to "in progress" before starting it and to "done" after completing it.

If no task tool is available, give the user a short progress update after each completed step instead.

### When to use

- with three or more subtasks or steps
- with complex tasks that have multiple phases
- when the user names several tasks at once

### When not to use

- with a single, trivial task
- when the task is done in fewer than three simple steps

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/runtime-state-safety.md`, when any wisdom, runtime migration, or worktree mutation below `.effective-flow/` is imminent.

**Load on demand:** Read `shared/effective-flow-dir-migration.md`, when any wisdom, runtime migration, or worktree mutation below `.effective-flow/` is imminent.

## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; effective-flow setup
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in effective-flow setup).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to effective-flow setup. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
effective-flow setup.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers (effective-flow setup, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, effective-flow setup may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, effective-flow setup may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:start -->

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
effective-flow setup path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in effective-flow setup.

Outside effective-flow setup, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to effective-flow setup.

<!-- runtime-state-safety: setup-repair-only:end -->

## Recommended skills

- `metro-english › humanizer` (fallback) – for thread replies and the summary comment only when
  resolved `language.forge` is `en`; do not apply English rewriting to German output

## Skill discovery

Before you start the actual implementation, planning, or review, survey the skills available in
the environment and pull in the ones useful for the concrete task. If the environment provides
no skill directory or none fits, this step is a no-op — continue without an error or a block.

### Approach

1. **Prefer recommended skills:** Preferentially apply the skills listed further above under
   "Recommended skills", provided they are available and relevant to the concrete task.
   "Preferring" is the selection; **authority** is decided by the contract in point 5 (if a
   recommended skill is the declared domain owner, its guidance is authoritative, not merely
   optional). A fallback notation `A › B` is an ordered preference: take the first available,
   non-excluded skill in the group, never both. If no such section exists (e.g. for tools),
   this point does not apply.
2. **Judge relevance:** Check each skill against the **concrete** task and pull in only the
   clearly fitting ones (typically 0–2). Do not load skills "on suspicion" — be token-frugal.
3. **Take config into account:** If present, read the `skills` block from the Effective Flow
   configuration (project-setup ADR) on a best-effort basis — the global fields plus your own
   scope entry (an agent reads `agents.<own-name>`, a tool reads `tools.<own-name>`).
   - `enabled: false` → skip the entire dynamic skill usage.
   - `exclude` (global or scope) → never apply these skills; an excluded fallback member is
     skipped in favor of the next fallback.
   - `include` (global or scope) → additionally consider these skills as preferred; a
     skill that is not installed is silently ignored.
   - If the block or the file is missing, the default applies (`enabled` on, no additional
     lists). Only read the config; do not migrate or write it here.
4. **Library docs:** When working against an unknown or current library or framework, use
   current-docs skills (e.g. `context7`) as needed, if available, instead of guessing from
   memory. Only when needed, never mandatory.
5. **Authority contract (orchestration vs. domain expertise):** Effective Flow and the central
   skills share the responsibility in a **layered** way — not "Effective Flow always wins":
   - **Effective Flow owns the orchestration** (the **what/when**): routing and user
     interaction, plan/report state, finding IDs, backlinks, tracker integration, resumability,
     agent selection and parallelization, baseline comparison, worktrees, commits, delivery,
     harness transform, and config. These rules, `AGENTS.md`/project conventions, plus its own
     language, commit, and scope rules **always** take precedence; no skill may widen scope,
     introduce new dependencies, or violate the agreed plan. In analysis/planning tools the
     no-code boundary stays strict.
   - **Central skills own reusable expertise** (the **how**): domain checklists, heuristics,
     standards, research procedures, and specialist guidance. If a recommended skill is the
     **declared domain owner** for the technical question at hand **and** covers it, its
     guidance is **authoritative** — not optional advice. The tool's own source then carries
     **no second copy** of that playbook, only scope/output/lifecycle constraints plus a
     minimal fallback (point 6).
   - **Edge cases:** If a skill only covers a special branch (_route-when-relevant_) or
     Effective Flow's product behavior deliberately diverges (_no-overlap_), the Effective Flow
     guidance stays leading. The binding assignment per skill/intersection is in the ownership
     inventory in the Developer Guide (`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`).
6. **Missing authoritative skill (minimal fallback):** If the authoritative skill is not
   available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via `exclude`), the
   **minimal generic fallback** left in the source applies — a short, essential core guidance
   so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly. **No** second full domain handbook is
   kept on hand; full depth comes only with the central skill.
7. **Report:** Briefly name which skills were used (or that none fit). If an orchestrator tool
   already handed you relevant skills, apply them and do not run a redundant full discovery.

## Project conventions

If the project contains an `AGENTS.md`, read it early in the workflow and observe its
specifications for implementation, commits, branch/PR conventions, and quality criteria.

## Completion protocol

When you use internal sub-agents, give them this response protocol:

- `DONE` for fully completed
- `ABORT: [reason]` for not completable

Check by the orchestrator:

1. `DONE`: phase completed.
2. `ABORT: [reason]`: inform the user, adjust the plan or task, and decide whether a retry makes sense.
3. No keyword: retry with escalation.

### Retry escalation

When an internal sub-agent ends without `DONE` or `ABORT`:

1. Retry 1: same task with a continuation hint
2. Retry 2: simplified task with reduced scope
3. Retry 3: minimal task for only the most critical subtask
4. After 3 failed attempts:
   - inform the user
   - clarify the options as free text: complete manually, continue with the next phase, abort the workflow

## Goal-driven completion control

Internal "repeat until done" loops of this workflow follow a uniform goal pattern instead of an ad-hoc formulated loop. The pattern adopts the three principles of the native `/goal` (Codex and Claude Code). At explicit goal gates, the directly following central `goal-start-action` fragment renders the action after an authorized autonomous choice per harness.

### The three principles

1. **Declare the completion condition up front.** Before the implementation work begins, formulate exactly one explicit, measurable completion condition. Derive it from the acceptance criteria and the validation plan of the basis (plan file, diagnosis or agreed scope). A good condition names the target state, the concrete check and the scope boundary – i.e. also what is deliberately not changed.
2. **Verify independently.** Do not check the condition by self-assessment, but via the independent instances anyway provided for it: ``effective-flow-code-validator`` for technical checks and the appropriate reviewer for content ones. The condition counts as fulfilled only once these instances confirm it.
3. **Loop with a bound.** If verification does not confirm the condition, fix the cause and verify again. Bound the internal correction rounds (guideline: three). If the condition still does not hold afterwards, abort the internal loop and escalate to the user instead of running on indefinitely – approach as in the retry escalation of the done protocol.

### Explicit goal query for autonomous runs

At the approval boundary of this workflow – where the completion condition is already fixed and the workflow is waiting for approval anyway – the user gets an **explicit choice** whether the remaining phases continue gated or autonomously under the native `/goal`. This replaces the earlier passive co-emitting of a `/goal` string: the option is actively queried, not merely offered. Workflows with this explicit gate include the central `goal-start-action` fragment directly after this control fragment.

#### When the query is omitted

Skip the goal query entirely (no extra option, no goal-start action and no `/goal` string) when the workflow runs as a **non-interactive sub-agent** of a superordinate orchestrator where no direct user interaction is intended – recognizable from the invocation context, for example "[Context from effective-flow apply-review: …]". `effective-flow apply-review` already steers its autonomous run at its own gate; an additional goal query per sub-delegation would be pointless there. Direct invocations and the handover through `effective-flow apply-plan` (interactive, individual) do **not** count as such delegation – there the goal query is retained.

#### Form of the query

- If the approval boundary is a yes/no approval, extend the approval question with a third option "Autonomous via `/goal`" next to "Yes" (continue gated) and "Adjust".
- If the approval boundary is a selection question (e.g. update groups) or if there is no yes/no approval at this boundary (e.g. because a planning phase was skipped), directly ask a concise standalone follow-up question "Run the remaining phases autonomously under `/goal`?". Depending on the interaction surface, use either yes/no answers or the explicit options "Continue gated" and "Autonomous via `/goal`".
- At the three-option approval gate, only "Autonomous via `/goal`" authorizes the harness-specific goal-start action; "Yes" continues gated and "Adjust" returns to clarification.
- At the standalone follow-up question, "Yes" or "Autonomous via `/goal`" authorizes the harness-specific goal-start action; "No" or "Continue gated" continues gated.
- No other response and no omitted query authorizes the goal-start action. On every gated path, **no** `/goal` string is emitted. The internal approval gates are retained in any case.

Rules for the `/goal` prompt and its objective in every harness path:

- **Self-sustaining:** Reference the underlying plan file, if present, and instruct to run through the remaining phases of this workflow – not "somehow make the criteria green".
- **Measurable:** Name the completion condition with the checks actually provided in the respective workflow (e.g. acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green and – if the workflow has a review phase – reviewer without open critical findings) and the scope boundary. Leave out checks that do not apply.
- **Platform-neutral objective:** Restrict yourself to the condition text after `/goal `; that exact text is both the direct Codex `objective` and the objective in every prompt handoff or fallback.
- **Copy-ready presentation:** Whenever a `/goal` prompt is output for the user to paste – including a fallback after a failed direct start – put the fully resolved single-line command as the sole content of a dedicated fenced `text` code block. Keep the cause, explanation and paste prompt outside the fence; do not add a label, comment or other text inside it.
- **Only at gate-free boundaries:** Offer the autonomous run exclusively at approval boundaries after which no further approval gate follows, so an autonomous run does not get stuck at a later gate.

Form (replace placeholders, single line):

```text
/goal Fully implement <plan file or agreed task> and run through the remaining phases of this workflow: all acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green<, reviewer without open critical findings – only if the workflow has a review phase>. Change nothing outside the scope. Stop when all criteria hold.
```

## Harness-specific goal-start action

When the explicit goal query in "Goal-driven completion control" authorizes an autonomous run, perform this harness-specific action:

After the user explicitly chooses the autonomous `/goal` option, output the full copy-pasteable `/goal` prompt prominently and ask the user to paste it as a new input. Use only this prompt handoff; without a pasted prompt, the workflow continues gated.

## Delivery and worktree integration

This shared fragment ties code-changing workflows to delivery branches, pull requests and
Git worktrees. The general values for base branch, branch-name construction and
completion action live in the `delivery` config block; the `worktree` block controls
exclusively whether and how the implementation runs in a separate Git worktree.

**By default the implementation runs in a Git worktree** (`worktree.enabled` default `true`):
an existing linked or harness-native worktree is reused, otherwise Effective Flow creates one
with its own branch. As soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated delivery branch,
**delivery is implicitly active** and completes via `merge`
(default) or `pr`. There is no separate `delivery.enabled` switch anymore (see
"Delivery is implied by worktree/branch").

Only when the user explicitly asks for in-place work without a worktree and wants no
branch/PR/merge action does the workflow behave as if without this fragment: no
forced branch creation, no forced commits and no automatic
PR creation.

`<plan.dir>` is the plan directory from the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) `plan.dir` (default
`docs/plan`).

### Roles of the config blocks

- **`delivery`** describes the delivery branch and its completion: base ref,
  branch prefix, completion action and return target.
- **`worktree`** describes exclusively the execution location: whether a worktree
  is used, where it lives and which setup runs in it.

Scope boundary: this fragment is **not** the per-finding worktree mechanism from
``tools/apply-review.md`` (`applyReview.worktree`). That one isolates parallel local
review findings and folds commits back onto the current branch via cherry-pick.
This fragment creates delivery branches for PR, merge or "branch only". Both
may use the same physical `baseDir`, since session and path segments
distinguish them.

## Verified execution location

Every write-capable phase and delegated worker uses an **execution-location receipt**. The
receipt keeps `EXECUTION_ROOT` and `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separate: tracked project work follows
the selected checkout, while private `.effective-flow/` state remains in the repository's main
checkout. It replaces any assumption that a one-time `cd`, an inherited current working
directory, or a subagent spawn option will keep later operations in the intended checkout.

### Receipt

Create the receipt before worktree creation, report-source resolution, or the first
write-capable action, whichever comes first. Pass it unchanged to every worker that may edit
files, read or mutate runtime state, run a formatter or a test that writes caches, run setup,
stage or commit, switch branches, or clean up a worktree. Record:

- the canonical absolute repository identity: the physical path returned by
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, resolved against the command's working directory when Git
  returns a relative path;
- `EXECUTION_ROOT`, the canonical absolute execution root from
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`;
- `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, the canonical absolute main-checkout root resolved by the procedure
  below;
- the checkout identity: either the exact branch name, or `detached` plus the exact commit OID
  when detached HEAD is explicitly expected;
- the origin: `in-place`, `harness-managed`, or `effective-flow-created`;
- setup ownership and status: who may run setup and whether it is pending, complete, skipped,
  or externally managed;
- the workflow or component that owns the receipt and its purpose.

Canonicalize paths before comparison: resolve symlinks, `..`, relative segments, and platform
case behavior through the host's physical-path facility. Path shape does not prove ownership.
A pre-existing user-created linked worktree counts as `harness-managed` for lifecycle purposes:
it is external to Effective Flow and must not be removed by this workflow.

### Runtime-state root

Before report-source resolution or any operation that may create or enter a delivery, native,
or component worktree, run `git worktree list --porcelain` from the verified current checkout.
Parse records by their empty-line separator and use only the first record, which Git defines as
the main worktree. The first record of `git worktree list --porcelain` must begin with exactly
one `worktree <path>` line. Reject a missing or duplicate path field, an empty path, or any record
that contains the boolean line `bare`. A `bare` first record has no usable main checkout and
therefore cannot own runtime state.

Canonicalize that path physically and require it to exist as a directory. From the candidate
root, require `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to resolve back to the same root and
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to resolve to the same canonical Git common directory recorded
as the repository identity in the execution receipt. Record the result as
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. In an in-place run from the main checkout, `EXECUTION_ROOT` and
`RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` are the same physical path. In a linked, native, delivery, or component
worktree, they differ.

Entering or creating another worktree changes only `EXECUTION_ROOT` and its checkout fields; it
must not change `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. Revalidate the retained runtime root from the current
porcelain first record and its common-directory identity before every runtime-state read or
mutation and after resume or Handoff. A missing, moved, newly bare, repository-mismatched, or
otherwise unusable runtime root fails closed. Preserve every checkout and all existing state;
never fall back to `EXECUTION_ROOT`. If the root is valid but its runtime-state safety checks
fail, direct the user to `effective-flow setup` as specified by that contract.

### Fail-closed preflight

At each write-capable orchestrator or worker boundary, and again after resume or Handoff,
verify from the receipt's absolute execution root:

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to the recorded execution root.
2. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves to the recorded repository identity.
3. `git branch --show-current` equals the recorded branch. If detached HEAD was explicitly
   recorded instead, the branch output must still be empty and `git rev-parse HEAD` must equal
   the recorded OID.
4. For a linked worktree, `git worktree list --porcelain` contains an entry whose canonical
   path and checkout identity match the receipt.

If any value is missing, cannot be canonicalized, or differs, abort before writing. Report the
expected and actual root and checkout identity, and retain every checkout. Do not edit, run
setup, run a formatter or test that may write, stage, commit, switch branches, or clean up.

After a Handoff or resume, a harness may provide a different execution root. Adopt it only by
issuing a new `harness-managed` receipt after proving the same repository identity and that the
expected work is present and consistent. Otherwise abort for reconciliation. A prior successful
preflight never authorizes later writes from an unverified runtime location.

### Rooted operations

After preflight, root tracked project, validation, staging, commit, and worktree lifecycle
operations in `EXECUTION_ROOT`:

- pass the absolute root as the per-call working directory when the harness supports it;
- use absolute paths for file tools;
- use `git -C <EXECUTION_ROOT> ...` for Git operations when a per-call working directory is not
  guaranteed.

Do not rely on a previous `cd` or on a worker inheriting the orchestrator's current directory.
If a worker cannot establish and verify the assigned root, it returns `ABORT` without writes.
Edits, validation, commits, and lifecycle operations for one receipt stay in that receipt's
execution root; component and delivery receipts are never interchangeable.

Root every `.effective-flow/` read, collision check, directory creation, report or backlink
write, cache or memory read/write, migration, and wisdom operation in `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`.
Resolve the concrete target to an absolute handle before entering another worktree and retain
that handle. For an existing path, physically canonicalize the path itself; for a target that
does not exist yet, physically canonicalize its nearest existing ancestor and append only the
validated missing path segments. The result must remain below the canonical absolute
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/` directory, and report handles must remain below
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/review/`. Reject `..`, path aliasing, or any existing
symlink that escapes those directories. A project-relative path is only presentation; it is
never an operational handle after the roots diverge.

### Harness-owned worktrees

- **Claude Code:** Subagents start from the parent context and directory changes do not persist
  as a portable cross-call contract. Native `isolation: worktree` creates a separate
  Claude-managed worktree. Use it only for a deliberately self-contained delegation that does
  not need an already selected Effective Flow worktree. Never combine native isolation with an
  assigned Effective Flow execution root.
- **Codex app:** A Codex app worktree is harness-managed, may start in detached HEAD, and remains
  associated with its task across Handoff. Reuse and revalidate it; do not wrap it in another
  Effective Flow worktree or remove it. Detached HEAD is valid only when the receipt explicitly
  pins its OID. If delivery requires a branch, create or adopt that branch through the supported
  app flow, then issue and verify a new branch receipt before committing.

### Setup and cleanup ownership

Automatic setup runs only when a receipt is `effective-flow-created` and its setup status is
`pending`. A reused linked or harness-native worktree is assumed to be prepared by its owner;
mark setup `externally managed` and do not repeat it. Run setup there only after an explicit user
request, or after reporting a missing prerequisite and obtaining the workflow's required
decision.

Remove a worktree or delete its temporary branch only when all of these are true:

1. Its receipt says `effective-flow-created` and names this workflow/component and purpose.
2. A fresh fail-closed preflight matches the recorded repository, root, and checkout identity.
3. `git worktree list --porcelain` still contains the matching entry.
4. The worktree is clean under the workflow's existing cleanup policy; unexpected untracked or
   modified files make it dirty.

If any proof fails, retain the worktree and branch and report why. Never force-remove a dirty,
moved, missing, mismatched, reused, in-place, user-owned, or harness-managed worktree. A failure
between `git worktree add` and successful receipt creation also leaves the new worktree in place
for manual reconciliation.

Cleanup targets only the exact Effective Flow-owned execution/component worktree named by its
receipt. It must never remove, rename, or otherwise alter `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` or use the runtime
root as a cleanup target. Runtime reports, backlinks, memory, caches, migrations, and wisdom
state remain in the main checkout after an owned worktree is removed.

### Configuration

If the Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR) pins corresponding values, they override these defaults (schema shown here for illustration):

```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "baseBranch": "origin/main",
    "branchPrefix": "effective-flow",
    "completion": "merge",
    "returnBranch": "auto"
  },
  "worktree": {
    "enabled": true,
    "setup": "auto",
    "baseDir": ".effective-flow/.worktrees"
  }
}
```

Missing values have these defaults:

- `delivery.baseBranch`: `"origin/main"`
- `delivery.branchPrefix`: `"effective-flow"`
- `delivery.completion`: `"merge"` (merge into the target branch as the default completion)
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` (local branch part from `delivery.baseBranch`)
- `worktree.enabled`: `true` (implementation runs in its own worktree)
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`
- `worktree.baseDir`: `.effective-flow/.worktrees`

Valid values:

- `delivery.completion`: `"pr"`, `"merge"`, `"branch"`
- `delivery.returnBranch`: `"auto"` or a local branch name as a string
- `worktree.enabled`: `true`, `false`
- `worktree.setup`: `"auto"`, `"none"` or an explicit setup command as a string

`delivery.enabled` is **retired**: delivery is no longer activated via its own switch,
but is active whenever work happens in a worktree/dedicated branch
(see "Delivery is implied by worktree/branch"). A `delivery.enabled` still
present in a legacy config is ignored on read and removed by the full config migration
(see "Config migration").

### Config migration

Reading the Effective Flow configuration from the project setup ADR and the one-time consolidation
of a legacy config onto the current schema – in particular moving old delivery values out of
`worktree.baseBranch`/`worktree.branchPrefix`/`worktree.completion` into `delivery.*` and
removing the retired `delivery.enabled` – is handled by the shared fragment
"Config migration" (`config-migration.md`) once and centrally. This fragment performs **no** own
per-block migration anymore. Until a config is migrated, reading applies: new value from
`delivery.*` before legacy value from `worktree.*` before default; an existing
`delivery.enabled` is ignored.

### Determine mode (setup phase): Delivery is implied by worktree/branch

At the start of the actual implementation work, determine the effective mode:

- Before any fetch, setup, branch change or other write-capable action, issue and verify an
  execution-location receipt for the current checkout. Before worktree creation, resolve and
  retain its verified `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` from the first record of
  `git worktree list --porcelain`; a path below `.effective-flow/.worktrees` does not prove
  ownership. Keep `EXECUTION_ROOT` and `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separate for the entire run.
- **Worktree execution is active by default** (`worktree.enabled` default `true`). It
  stays off only when `worktree.enabled: false` is set or the user explicitly requests
  in-place work ("without worktree", "directly on the current branch").
- When the current receipt points to an existing linked or harness-native worktree rather than
  the repository's main worktree, reuse it as `harness-managed`. Do not create a nested delivery
  worktree, switch its branch, repeat automatic setup or remove it during handback.
- **Delivery is active as soon as work happens in a worktree or on a dedicated delivery
  branch** – so in the default case always. In addition, delivery is active when the
  user explicitly requests PR, branch or merge work (even with in-place work; then
  the delivery branch is created in the main repo).
- If the worktree is disabled via config (`worktree.enabled: false`), give a brief
  note that the (default) worktree mode is off via config. If the user then also
  requests no delivery action, perform no further steps from this fragment
  (in-place without delivery).

### Shared preconditions

When delivery or worktree is active:

1. `git` and, for worktree execution, `git worktree` must be available. The current execution
   receipt must pass the fail-closed preflight before continuing.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` must be resolvable. If it is a remote ref (e.g.
   `origin/main`), first run `git fetch REMOTE BRANCH`, so the delivery branch
   starts from the current remote state.
3. If the current HEAD has relevant uncommitted changes or local commits that
   are not contained in `delivery.baseBranch`, point that out. A delivery branch freshly
   created from the base branch does not contain this work. Only continue
   if the user confirms the chosen mode or the workflow creates a safe
   partial-diff PR by the procedure described below.
4. Construct delivery branch names: `<delivery.branchPrefix>/<skill>/<slug>`, e.g.
   `effective-flow/build/user-login`. Derive the slug from the plan title, the task description,
   the issue or finding. If the branch name already exists, append a
   numeric suffix and report the chosen name.

### Run-owned delivery state

Before creating or switching any delivery artifact, retain the original verified
execution-location receipt and initialize explicit current-run ownership flags for the delivery
worktree and branch. After the current run creates a delivery branch, record its exact name and
creation OID immediately; do not substitute the base ref or a later-moving remote tip. After the
current run creates a worktree, record that ownership separately from its
`effective-flow-created` receipt. A name, path, configured base directory or pre-existing receipt
never proves current-run ownership.

Carry this state through baseline validation and every later phase:

- original checkout receipt and checkout identity,
- delivery branch name and exact creation OID,
- whether this run created the delivery branch,
- whether this run created the delivery worktree,
- the delivery execution-location receipt.

For a reused `harness-managed` or user-managed worktree or branch, both creation flags stay
false. For in-place execution without delivery, no delivery artifact is recorded.

### Worktree execution

When worktree execution is active:

1. If the current receipt identifies a linked or harness-native worktree, keep that root and
   checkout identity and mark setup as `externally managed`. A detached harness-native checkout
   remains valid only at its pinned OID. If delivery requires a branch, create or adopt it
   through the harness-supported flow and issue a new verified receipt before committing; never
   silently switch a harness-managed worktree. The linked or native checkout becomes
   `EXECUTION_ROOT`; the porcelain main checkout remains `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`.
2. Otherwise determine the repo name from `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and use
   `worktree.baseDir` (default `.effective-flow/.worktrees`) as the base dir. Worktree path:
   `BASE_DIR/REPO_NAME/SESSION_ID`. Resolve a relative `BASE_DIR` against
   `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, never against a disposable worktree. When that path is below
   `.effective-flow/`, resolve every missing base or parent directory that will be created.
   From `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, apply the owning workflow's loaded “Runtime-state write safety”
   contract to each exact directory path immediately before its `mkdir`; a guard for the
   eventual worktree path does not authorize creating its parents. Apply the contract again to
   the exact `WORKTREE_PATH` immediately before `git worktree add`.
   Create the worktree and delivery branch with
   `git worktree add <WORKTREE_PATH> -b <BRANCH_NAME> <BASE_REF>`, then immediately issue and
   verify an `effective-flow-created` receipt for the exact path, branch, workflow and delivery
   purpose. Record both artifacts as current-run-owned and capture the branch's exact creation
   OID before setup. If receipt creation or state recording fails, retain the worktree and branch
   for manual reconciliation.
3. Only for that newly Effective Flow-created receipt, run setup per `worktree.setup` and
   briefly announce the mode beforehand:
   - `auto` or missing: decide by lockfile – `pnpm-lock.yaml` →
     `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`, `package-lock.json` →
     `npm ci`, `yarn.lock` → `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, `Cargo.toml` →
     `cargo fetch --locked`, `go.mod` → `go mod download`, `uv.lock` →
     `uv sync --frozen`, `poetry.lock` → `poetry install --sync`, no known
     file → no setup.
   - `none`: run no setup.
   - String value: run this explicit command in the worktree.
     Record the final setup status as `complete` or `skipped` before delegation.
4. Pass the full receipt, including both roots, to every subsequent phase and delegated worker
   that creates or changes code, tests, documentation, or runtime state. Each boundary runs the
   fail-closed preflight. Project operations are explicitly rooted in `EXECUTION_ROOT`; runtime
   reads and writes use retained absolute handles below `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`. This also applies
   through the completion phase and the final validator/formatter.

### In-place delivery without worktree

When delivery is active and worktree execution stays off:

1. Keep and verify the current checkout's `in-place` receipt, and remember the originally
   checked-out branch.
2. Ensure the working tree contains no uncommitted changes that
   should not become part of the delivery branch. If such changes exist,
   do not silently stage, stash or overwrite them; either obtain a user decision
   or use the partial-diff PR via worktree.
3. Create and check out the delivery branch from `delivery.baseBranch`.
4. Issue a new receipt for the delivery branch after switching. Record the branch as
   current-run-owned and capture its exact creation OID before setup or implementation. Run
   implementation, tests, validation and final formatting through explicitly rooted operations
   after a successful preflight at every write-capable boundary.
5. After completion, proceed per "Handback and completion action".

### Partial-diff PR via worktree

When the main checkout already holds changes that should not fully go into the PR,
a separate worktree is the preferred safe path, provided these
preconditions are met:

1. `git worktree` is available.
2. `delivery.baseBranch` is resolvable and, for remote refs, updatable.
3. The workflow knows an explicit list of the files that should go into the PR.

The procedure:

1. Create a fresh worktree branch from `delivery.baseBranch`, then immediately issue and verify
   a separate `effective-flow-created` receipt whose purpose is `partial-diff`.
2. Take only the selected delivery files from the main checkout into the worktree.
   Permitted sources for this selection are plan affected files,
   review finding scope, issue scope, known files produced by the workflow, or
   an explicit user selection.
3. In the verified execution root, check whether the taken-over files produce a meaningful diff
   against the base ref. If not, abort and create no empty PR.
4. Commit in the verified execution root and run `effective-flow pr` against
   `delivery.baseBranch`.
5. Remove the worktree only after the receipt passes the ownership-safe cleanup checks. Leave
   the delivery branch locally and the main checkout unchanged. Non-selected changes in the
   main checkout remain untouched.

A heuristic partial-diff selection by "all changed files
except <plan.dir>" is not allowed. The workflow must know the files to include or
ask. This reliably keeps newly created plans, `.effective-flow/` state and other
local working files outside the PR.

### What lives in the delivery branch and what stays in the main repo

Data-keeping invariant: **Of the Effective Flow artifacts, only plans are
committed.** Reviews (local reports) and investigations always stay local and
untracked; in remote mode reviews are tracked as issues instead (never in the repo),
investigations remain purely local in any case (see "Issue-tracker integration" and
`effective-flow investigate`).

- **In the delivery branch:** the actual code, test and documentation deliverables of the
  workflow as well as – if the workflow kept a plan file – its final
  state (in the implemented case the archived, implemented-marked plan file).
- **Only in the main repo, never committed:** pure Effective Flow bookkeeping and runtime state, i.e.
  all remaining `.effective-flow/` artifacts – `memory.json`, `cache.json`, local review reports
  under `.effective-flow/review/`, investigation reports under `.effective-flow/investigation/`,
  config migration status and wisdom files. Their operational paths are absolute handles below
  `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, even while tracked work executes elsewhere.

### Abort handback before implementation

Use this handback only when a workflow must abort after delivery setup but before implementation,
for example when `maintain` finds a red baseline. It is separate from normal completion: do not
mark or archive a plan, commit, ask for or execute a completion action, push, merge or create a
pull request. Preserve all abort diagnostics before lifecycle cleanup.

Fail closed. Mutate only artifacts that the retained run-owned delivery state proves were created
by the current run:

1. **No delivery artifacts:** For in-place execution without delivery, perform no lifecycle
   cleanup. Report the unchanged checkout.
2. **Externally managed state:** For `harness-managed`, user-managed or adopted worktrees and
   branches, perform no lifecycle mutation. Report every retained path or branch and that it is
   externally managed.
3. **Effective Flow-owned worktree:** Only when both current-run creation flags are true and the
   receipt is `effective-flow-created`, freshly revalidate repository identity, execution root,
   checkout identity, purpose, worktree registration and clean status. Verify that both `HEAD`
   and the delivery branch tip still equal the recorded creation OID. If every proof passes, run
   `git worktree remove <WORKTREE_PATH>` without force. Revalidate that the branch still exists at
   the recorded creation OID and then delete it safely with `git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`. Never
   compare against a moving remote tip.
4. **In-place transient branch:** Only when the current run created the delivery branch, freshly
   verify the delivery receipt, clean status, exact branch name and recorded creation OID. Verify
   that the retained original checkout belongs to the same repository and can still be restored.
   Restore the original branch or detached OID first, revalidate its retained receipt, then
   revalidate and safely delete the unchanged transient branch with
   `git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`.
5. **Retention and partial cleanup:** Any dirty state, changed tip, ownership mismatch, receipt or
   registration mismatch, failed restoration, ordinary worktree-removal failure or safe
   branch-deletion refusal retains the affected artifact. Report its exact path or branch and the
   failed proof or command. If worktree removal or original-checkout restoration succeeds but
   branch deletion fails, report that partial cleanup explicitly and retain the branch. Never
   force-remove a worktree or force-delete a branch in this abort handback.

End the workflow immediately after reporting the abort handback. Do not enter implementation or
normal delivery completion.

### Handback and completion action (completion phase)

Following the workflow's regular completion logic (including goal verification).
The final status switch of the plan file to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` and its
archiving is handled by step 1 below at the delivery point – the implementing workflow therefore does **not** set the
status beforehand, but leaves it to this phase (exception: in-place without
delivery, see step 1):

**Update existing PRs:** If the delivery branch already has a pull request
and subsequent changes are needed, those changes are always created and pushed as new
commits on the same PR branch. Existing PR commits must not
be rewritten via `commit --amend`, interactive rebase, squash or force-push.
If a normal push fails because of diverged remote history,
stop and report the conflict instead of overwriting history.

1. **Mark the plan as implemented, archive it and take it into the delivery branch:**
   Provided the workflow kept a plan file, this is the **delivery point** at which
   the plan counts as implemented (immediately before the PR is opened or the delivery branch
   is merged):
   - Set the canonical status marker to `Umgesetzt`/`Implemented` (preserve the complete plan
     language: German plan → `**Planungsstatus:** Umgesetzt`, English plan →
     `**Plan status:** Implemented`).
   - Move the plan file via `git mv` to `<plan.dir>/archive/` (create the directory if
     needed), per "Archive of implemented plans" of the plan-file convention.
   - If the implementation ran in a worktree or partial-diff worktree, provide this final,
     archived and implemented-marked state in the worktree (under
     `<plan.dir>/archive/<file>`). Marking and move are **committed along with it** and
     are thereby part of the PR/merge (implementation documentation). The `.effective-flow/` artifacts stay in the
     main repo.
   - If the workflow kept no plan file, this step does not apply.
   - If the workflow exceptionally runs in-place without delivery (no worktree, no
     branch/PR/merge action), the workflow performs the same status switch and
     archive move directly in the working tree; the final commit/merge into the
     target branch is then the delivery event.
2. **Ensure commit:** Commit all intended changes in the delivery branch
   – code, test and documentation deliverables as well as the taken-over plan file – via the
   commit logic from `effective-flow commit` (stage exclusively known changed files
   explicitly, derive a concrete Conventional Commit message, never set a
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer). Resolve `language.git` for the human-readable commit description;
   keep Conventional Commit types stable. Workflows that have already committed their work
   (e.g. `effective-flow maintain` with one commit per group) only commit the
   plan file here afterwards, if needed. If there is nothing to commit: inform the user,
   remove an automatically created empty delivery branch and end without
   PR/merge.
3. **Determine completion action:** If `delivery.completion` has a valid value,
   use it and briefly report that the action was taken from the Effective Flow configuration
   (project setup ADR). Otherwise ask:

If Delivery was active and no valid value for `delivery.completion` is set: Ask the user: **How should the delivery branch be completed?**
- Pull request -- Push the branch and create a PR against the base branch via pr
- Merge -- Merge the branch locally into the base branch, without a PR
- Branch only -- Leave the branch in the local repo, no further action

4. **Withdraw an Effective Flow-owned worktree:** Only when the receipt is
   `effective-flow-created`, freshly reverify its repository, root, checkout identity, purpose
   and clean state, then run `git worktree remove <WORKTREE_PATH>`; retain the delivery branch
   in the local repo. If any proof fails or uncommitted remnants remain, keep the worktree and
   report the path and mismatch. For `in-place` and `harness-managed` receipts, perform no
   worktree cleanup; leave lifecycle handling to the user or harness. The verified
   `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` is never a cleanup target, and local review state there remains intact.
5. **Execute action:**
   - `branch` / Branch only: leave the branch, report the name and a note about later
     PR creation.
   - `merge`: the target is the local branch part of `delivery.baseBranch` or the
     explicit `delivery.returnBranch`. Ensure that the target working tree
     is clean; otherwise inform instead of merging. If the local target branch is
     behind its remote-tracking ref, point that out. Merge the delivery branch –
     prefer fast-forward, otherwise a merge commit; on conflict stop, leave the branch
     and inform the user, no automatic conflict resolution.
   - `pr`: delegate to `effective-flow pr` and pass the delivery branch, base branch and the
     workflow/change type (`feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`docs`/`chore` depending on the implementing
     workflow and effect) as a title-type hint, so the PR title carries a
     valid Conventional Commit type — with a squash merge it is the release signal.
6. **Restore checkout:** For in-place delivery that switched the current checkout, after
   successful PR creation or with `branch`, switch back to `delivery.returnBranch` or, with
   `auto`, to the local branch part of `delivery.baseBranch`, provided the working tree is clean.
   Do not switch a reused harness-managed checkout. If an applicable switch-back fails,
   explicitly report the actual branch as a side effect.

## PR review comment integration

This shared building block connects `effective-flow iterate` with the review comments of an
existing pull request (GitHub via `gh`, Forgejo via `tea`). It encapsulates the
**PR-specific plumbing** that `issue-tracker.md` deliberately does not contain: PR resolution,
reading review threads, replying to a thread, resolving a thread, and posting a PR summary
comment.

Boundary to `issue-tracker.md`: that building block is tailored to **issues** and the
`tracker.mode` switch. PR review threads are a different API object.
`effective-flow iterate` is – like ``tools/apply-issues.md``/`effective-flow plan-issue` – **inherently
remote** in PR mode and does not evaluate `tracker.mode`; it merely needs a
Git repository, an `origin` remote, and an authenticated CLI. The **host and
CLI detection** is taken from `issue-tracker.md` (not reinvented); this building block
only adds the PR operations.

### No AI attribution

Do not add AI attribution to thread replies or the summary comment: no „Generated
with Claude Code/Codex" footers, no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`),
and no `Co-Authored-By` trailers – not even when the harness appends them as a default.
Reply texts in natural language according to the language rules.

Resolve `language.forge` once for newly authored remote prose. A reply preserves the clearly
recognizable language of the existing thread; otherwise it uses `language.forge`. The per-run
summary comment uses `language.forge`. HTML markers, thread IDs, states, and helper payload fields
remain stable and are never translated.

### Remote helper

Use the shipped `scripts/remote-tracker.mjs` helper and the envelope, dry-run, capability,
redaction, and error contract from `issue-tracker.md`. PR mode requires a successful provider
probe. `AMBIGUOUS_HOST` returns to the orchestrator for an explicit provider choice;
`CLI_MISSING`/`AUTH_FAILED` abort without side effects. Never assemble provider requests or
discover flags in the prompt.

### PR resolution

Resolve the target PR from the argument or the current branch and determine the PR number,
head branch, base branch, URL, and state:

- **From argument:** a PR reference is a bare number (`42`), `#42`, or a PR URL. A
  PR URL carries the segment `/pull/` (GitHub) or `/pulls/` (Forgejo) – this distinguishes it
  from an issue URL (`/issues/`).
- **From the current branch:** if no PR reference was passed, try to determine the open PR of the
  currently checked-out branch.

Use helper reference parsing followed by the normalized PR read/list operations. For current-
branch resolution, list open PRs for the exact head branch and require exactly one match.

If the PR is already `merged`/`closed`: report and push no commits (see error cases in
`effective-flow iterate`).

### Read review threads (always fresh)

Read the review comments **directly before** classification fresh from the host – comments
can change between runs. Capture per thread: thread ID, author (and whether bot or
human), file + line, comment text, and the `resolved` status.

Use the normalized review-thread read and PR-comment read operations. The normalized author
record includes `login`, `isBot`, and `authorType`; when Forgejo does not expose a bot flag and
the login has no canonical bot suffix, `authorType` is `unknown` rather than guessed as human.
If the provider reports that resolved status is unavailable, keep the item unresolved and expose
that limitation in the workflow summary; do not guess.

### Reply to a thread

Use the helper's review-thread reply operation. Every reply carries the marker
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` (see idempotency).

### Resolve a thread

Use the helper's review-thread resolve operation. On `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`, keep the reply,
leave the thread unresolved, and note that manual resolution is needed; do not improvise.

### Post summary comment

Use the helper's PR-comment payload builder and PR-comment mutation. Per run, **exactly one**
summary comment with the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` is
posted: which points were implemented, which skipped, and which pure questions are listed as
open/deferred.

### Idempotency via the Effective Flow marker

Replies and the summary comment carry the HTML marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`. Read
the existing PR and review comments **fresh before every write**: a thread that is
already `resolved` or carries an `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->` reply is considered done and
is not processed again. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present old marker
`<!-- firmo-iterate -->` from an earlier run is recognized as equivalent on read (no
double processing of in-flight threads); newly written is exclusively
`<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`. This keeps a second `effective-flow iterate` run on the same PR
clean.

### No history rewriting

New work goes exclusively as **new commits** onto the PR head branch and is pushed normally –
consistent with `effective-flow pr` and "Updating existing PRs" in the delivery
and worktree integration. No `commit --amend`, no rebase, no squash, no force-push.
If the push is rejected because of diverged remote history, stop and report the conflict
instead of overwriting history.

## Wisdom Accumulation

At the start, generate a session ID (e.g. via timestamp) and use
`.effective-flow/.wisdom-accumulation-<SESSION_ID>.tmp.md` for:

- the resolved PR (number, head/base branch, URL) or the local target diff
- the review threads read, with author, file/line, and resolved status
- the classification per item (actionable/not actionable, action type, already addressed)
- implemented items, commits created, threads replied to/resolved
- deferred pure questions and failed items

Write a summary after each phase and pass it on to later phases. Delete the file at the
end.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Target detection and input parsing

1. Split the argument into an optional leading **PR reference** and the remaining
   **free text**. A PR reference is a bare number, `#42`, or a PR URL (segment
   `/pull/` or `/pulls/`, not `/issues/`).
2. Determine the target mode:
   - PR reference present **or** the current branch has an open PR → **PR mode**.
   - otherwise → **Local mode**.
3. On ambiguity (e.g. a bare number that could also be an issue) ask,
   instead of guessing.
4. `iterate` always continues an **existing** change; there is no full intent gate as
   in effective-flow build.

### Phase 1: Gather context

- **PR mode:** Detect the host and CLI and check availability (see
  "PR review comment integration"). Resolve the PR and read the review threads **fresh**.
  Take the free-text instructions in as additional items. Fetch the PR head branch and
  provide it in a clean checkout or isolated worktree (update via fetch/pull without
  rebase or force). If the PR is already merged/closed, report that and optionally offer
  local mode.
- **Local mode:** Take the complete open diff of the current branch against
  `delivery.baseBranch` (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) as context. The source of the items to
  implement is only the free text.

### Phase 2: Classification

Determine per item (review thread or free-text instruction):

1. **actionable vs. not actionable:**
   - pure praise/info comments do not count as actionable.
   - **Nitpick and low-priority bot comments are taken along as actionable by
     default** – the approval gate in phase 2.5 lets the user deselect individual ones.
   - **pure questions** without a need for code changes are not implemented and are **not
     automatically answered in substance**; they are listed in the summary as open/deferred
     so the user answers them themselves.
2. **already addressed:** thread is `resolved` or carries a `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`
   reply → skip.
3. Derive the **action type**:
   - effective-flow fix for a bug/correction,
   - effective-flow refactor for structure without behavior change,
   - effective-flow build for small new functionality,
   - effective-flow docs for pure documentation.
     Treat human and bot comments equally.
4. Create a task per actionable item (per-item granularity).

### Phase 2.5: Approval

Show the classified items (actionable, skipped, deferred questions) and obtain an
approval. Without approval **no** externally visible action takes place (no push, no
comment). Handle the response per "Explicit goal query for autonomous runs": on "Autonomous
via /goal" perform the central harness-specific goal-start action for phases 3–6. The query is omitted if `iterate`
was delegated non-interactively (e.g. by effective-flow apply-review).

Ask the user: **Approve and implement the classified items?**
- Yes -- Approval granted, implementation and delivery-back continue gated
- Autonomous via /goal -- Remaining phases autonomously under native /goal after this explicit selection (omitted for non-interactive delegation)
- Adjust -- Enter feedback as free text, e.g. deselect individual items

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Before delegation, record the analyzed file ownership of every actionable item. Items whose
   analyzed file sets overlap run sequentially; only items with disjoint sets may implement in
   parallel.
2. Delegate each actionable item to the appropriate skill (effective-flow fix, effective-flow refactor,
   effective-flow build, or effective-flow docs), on the PR head branch (PR mode) or the current
   branch (local mode). Each delegation receives its analyzed owned paths and reports its actual
   paths. If it discovers that it must touch a path outside its analyzed set, it must stop before
   modifying that path and return it to the orchestrator. Add the path to the item's actual
   ownership, compare it with every active item's analyzed and actual paths, and serialize the
   affected items before allowing work on that path to continue. Never let two active items edit
   the same path based only on the original analysis.
3. **One commit per thread/item** with a clean conventional-commit message without internal
   IDs or a thread reference and without `Co-Authored-By`. Independent items may implement in
   parallel, but every item uses the commit-integrity mutex below for staging and committing.
   Resolve `language.git` once and pass it to every item for its commit description.
4. Give internal delegation sub-agents the completion protocol and check for `DONE` or
   `ABORT`. On `ABORT`: mark the item as failed and continue with the next.

#### Commit integrity for parallel items

The following mutex applies in both PR and local mode. Parallel delegations may edit disjoint
files concurrently, but all operations that mutate or inspect the shared Git index and `HEAD`
for an item run in one critical section.

Mutex convention:

- Retain one absolute lock handle for the repository at
  `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/iterate-commit.lock`. Every item delegation in this
  `iterate` run uses that same handle, including when the execution checkout is an isolated
  worktree.
- Apply "Runtime-state write safety" from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT` separately and immediately before
  every mutation of the exact lock directory or its `owner` file. Guard the repository-relative
  target `.effective-flow/iterate-commit.lock` before each acquisition attempt; do not create,
  remove, or modify the lock when a guard blocks.
- Acquire the lock atomically with `mkdir <absolute-lock-handle>`. Immediately after successful
  acquisition, write `<absolute-lock-handle>/owner` with the item identity, delegation identity,
  a unique acquisition token, and timestamp. The successful acquisition and matching owner
  record together prove ownership.
- If the lock exists, read its owner for diagnostics, wait, and retry without touching the index.
  Never infer permission to remove it from age alone. If it appears orphaned, obtain explicit
  user confirmation before removal, then rerun the runtime-state guards for the exact owner file
  and lock directory immediately before deleting either.
- Release the lock on every success, abort, and error path, but only after rereading the owner
  file and verifying that its complete identity and acquisition token match the current item.
  If ownership cannot be verified, do not remove or alter the lock; fail closed and report the
  mismatch.

Before acquiring the mutex, finish the item's configured pre-commit checks. Then, while holding
the lock for the entire sequence:

1. Run `git status --porcelain` and inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and
   `git diff --cached`. If any staged state already exists, treat it as foreign: do not commit,
   take it over, or clean it up. Release the verified-owned lock and return `ABORT` for the item.
2. Reconfirm that the item's explicit stage list contains only its analyzed and dynamically
   approved actual paths. Stage exactly those paths. Never use `git add .`, `git add -A`,
   `git commit -a`, or an equivalent blanket operation.
3. Inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and require it to equal the explicit item-owned path
   set, then inspect the complete `git diff --cached` and require every staged hunk to belong to
   the current item. Record the verified staged paths and content before committing.
4. Create the item's conventional commit, capture its hash immediately with
   `git rev-parse HEAD`, and write the `item identity -> commit hash` mapping to the wisdom file.
5. Immediately confirm the committed paths and content against the recorded staged diff. Run
   `git status --porcelain`, require `git diff --cached` to be empty, and inspect the remaining
   working-tree diff. Changes from other active items may remain only when they are unstaged and
   outside this item's owned paths; record that residual state in the wisdom file.

If a check fails before the commit, unstage only paths whose staging is provably attributable to
this item in the current lock acquisition, verify the resulting cached state, release the lock
only after owner verification, and return `ABORT`. Never unstage or otherwise clean foreign
changes. If immediate post-commit confirmation fails, do not amend, reset, rebase, or otherwise
rewrite history: record the discrepancy, release the verified-owned lock, mark the item failed,
and stop delivery for reconciliation.

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Start `effective-flow-code-validator` or the project-wide quality gate.
2. Fix errors found and verify again per "Goal-driven completion control":
   limit the internal correction rounds and escalate to the user if the checks still fail
   afterwards.

### Phase 5: Delivery back (PR mode only)

1. Push the head branch normally (no force). If the push fails due to diverged remote history:
   stop, report the conflict, overwrite no history, and resolve no threads.
2. Reply briefly per addressed thread, preserving the clearly established thread language or
   otherwise using resolved `language.forge`, and resolve it through the remote helper's normalized
   review-thread operations. If resolution is an unsupported provider capability, keep the reply
   and report the required manual resolution. Use the marker `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`.
3. Post **one** summary comment on the PR in resolved `language.forge` (marker
   `<!-- effective-flow-iterate -->`): which items
   were implemented or skipped and which pure questions are open/deferred (without a
   substantive auto-reply).

### Phase 6: Summary

1. Delete the wisdom file.
2. Give the user a summary:
   - table: implemented / skipped / deferred questions / failed
   - PR URL, pushed commits, resolved threads, final checkout state
   - in local mode: which commits were created on which branch

## Rules

## Pre-commit gate

Before every commit, the checks configured in the project must pass without errors. Typical checks are type-checking, linting, and tests — use the scripts defined in the project (e.g. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm agent:check`).

- If a check reports errors: fix the errors first, then check again.
- Never commit code that does not pass these checks.
- This rule applies even when a separate verification phase exists — it is an additional safeguard, not a replacement.

## Commit message rules

- Resolve `language.git` through the shared language rule and write the human-readable subject
  description and body in that language. Preserve a valid user-supplied message. Conventional
  Commit types, optional scopes, `!`, trailer keys, issue references, and other machine tokens
  remain English/ASCII. This rule also governs Conventional Commit PR-title descriptions and
  explicitly generated changelog/release-note prose.
- **Never set `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commit messages**, regardless of whether an LLM (Claude, Codex, GPT, …) or another tool suggests the line or inserts it as a default.
- If a `Co-Authored-By` line is already present in a commit template, `commit.template`, a `--trailer` invocation, or a draft message: remove it before committing.
- **Do not add AI attribution:** no „Generated with Claude Code/Codex" footers and no agent session links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/…`) in commit messages – not even when the harness appends them as a default. Factual mentions of Claude Code or Codex remain allowed, generation attribution does not.
- Avoid generic messages like `update files` or `misc changes`.
- Describe concretely what was changed and why.
- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Choose the commit type by **effect**, not by file type: behavior-changing changes – including pure **config/env/secrets/CI** with deployment or runtime effect (e.g. corrected values in env/secret artifacts that take effect remotely via sync) – are `fix:` (or `feat:` for new functionality). `chore:` only for **deploy-neutral** changes without behavioral effect (pure maintenance, formatting, tooling without runtime effect). This also applies to the **squash PR title**, which determines the release-please bump on a squash merge.
- Do not expose internal tracking IDs in commit messages, e.g. review finding IDs like `R-0000001`, local plan/review IDs like `F1`, or placeholders like `[Finding-ID]`. Such IDs belong in wisdom/report context, not in the Git history.

- Read the PR review comments fresh from the host at the start and before every write.
- Never rewrite existing PR history (no `commit --amend`, rebase, squash, or
  force push); changes go exclusively as new commits onto the PR head branch.
- In PR mode, create no new delivery branch and no new PR.
- Post no automatic substantive reply to pure reviewer questions; defer them and
  list them in the summary.
- Never set a `Co-Authored-By` trailer and add no AI attribution in commits,
  thread replies, the summary comment, or the PR body.
- Give the user a brief status update after each phase.
- On a missing or unauthenticated CLI: abort cleanly, do not secretly push a local
  implementation.
