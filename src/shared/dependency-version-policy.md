## External dependency introduction

`effective-delivery` is the declared domain owner for dependency research and upgrades, including
selecting and introducing a new external package, crate, action, image, SDK, toolchain, or other
versioned dependency. When the current task needs one, apply that skill through the current
agent's skill discovery before changing a manifest, lockfile, workflow, or tool configuration.
Pass it the missing capability, local runtime and compatibility constraints, allowed files, and
Effective Flow's delivery boundary. Effective Flow retains scope approval, worktrees, commits, and
delivery.

If the owner is unavailable, use only this minimal fallback: verify the current stable release
from official registry or upstream evidence; avoid prereleases unless explicitly required;
choose the highest stable version allowed by a concrete compatibility constraint; and use the
repository's native package tool so manifest and generated lock state stay consistent. Do not
broaden the task into unrelated dependency maintenance.
