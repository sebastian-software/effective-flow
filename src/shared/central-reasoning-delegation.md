## Delegating the domain judgment to central skills

The **generic technical judgment** of the calling tool — for planning, the plan-quality and
plan-review discipline (executable-plan sharpness, gap/drift checking, scope, evidence,
verification, maintenance focus) — is owned by the central skill `codebase-improvement`.
Effective Flow is the **artifact orchestrator** here, not a second domain handbook: the tool's
own source carries **no second copy** of these heuristics, but delegates the judgment and
normalizes the result into its own artifact contract (status, scorecard/finding form, open
points, handoff).

### What gets delegated (the "how" of the judgment)

- generic quality heuristics: over-engineering, scope creep, unspoken assumptions, missing or
  non-measurable acceptance criteria, edge cases, implementation risks, evidence vs. guessing,
  verifiability;
- the review **judgment** (which findings hold and how heavily they weigh) at the artifact
  level.

For this, apply `codebase-improvement`, provided it is available and relevant to the concrete
task; it is the **default owner** for this generic reasoning. Afterwards you bring the result
into the Effective Flow artifact form.

### Specialists only at a crossed boundary (one generic rule)

Declared domain owners are **not** hard-wired per skill, but loaded via **one** rule: if the
concrete task crosses the declared boundary of a specialist, load its owner via the relevance
gate (building block "Skill discovery") and the ownership inventory
(`docs/developer-guide/skill-ownership.md`). Typical owners:

<!-- skill-ownership:relevance-gate-owners ["product-management","product-design","effective-web","software-architecture","web-legal-compliance"] -->

- `product-management` — product outcomes, what/why/for-whom, prioritization, release judgment;
- `product-design` — research, problem framing, information architecture, flows, prototype;
- `effective-web` — browser implementation and accessibility detail;
- further declared owners (e.g. `software-architecture`, `web-legal-compliance`) analogously.

The relevance gate **keeps narrow tasks narrow**: a small engineering plan loads neither
product nor design owners, and product discovery is not forced.

### Authority contract and minimal fallback

The layered contract from the building block "Skill discovery" applies: Effective Flow owns the
**orchestration** (artifact lifecycle, status, open points, handoff, user interaction, and the
respective no-code/edit boundary), the central skills own the **domain judgment**. If the
authoritative skill is not available (not installed, `skills.enabled: false`, or disabled via
`exclude`), a **minimal generic fallback** applies: a short, essential core checklist
(over-engineering, scope creep, missing measurable acceptance criteria, edge cases,
implementation risks) so the tool stays functional and degrades cleanly — **not** a full local
handbook.
