## Automatic reviewer state

This shared building block answers exactly two questions about one configured automatic reviewer
against one pull-request head: **is it still running**, and **has it run for this head?** The gate
`{{SKILL:merge-gate}}` and the review-in-flight guard of `{{SKILL:iterate}}` both take their answer
from here, so the two never drift into disagreeing about the same pull request.

The reviewers are the logins in `mergeGate.bots`; a reviewer's optional check context is
`mergeGate.bots.<login>.check`. An empty `mergeGate.bots` list means no automatic reviewer is
expected and there is nothing to observe.

### Matching a configured login

A configured `mergeGate.bots` login and a login reported by a read surface denote the same reviewer
when they are equal after trimming **one trailing** `[bot]` from each — and that trim applies only to
a reported record the surface typed as a bot, `isBot: true` or equivalently `authorType: bot`. A
reported login that is **not** bot-typed denotes the same reviewer only when it equals the configured
one **exactly**. Apart from the trim the comparison is exact either way; `isBot` and `authorType`
gate the trim and decide nothing else, and no further author field takes part at all — a display
name, a profile URL and an account ID decide nothing here. A `[bot]` anywhere but at the end of a
login is part of that login and is never trimmed.

**The two surfaces spell one account differently, and that is why this rule exists.** GitHub's REST
API reports a bot account with the `[bot]` suffix while its GraphQL API reports the same account
without it, so a reviewer's pull-request comments and its review threads arrive under two spellings.
No single configured value matches both. Configured the REST way, every rule that reads review
threads matches nothing and reports itself satisfied; configured the GraphQL way, every rule that
reads pull-request comments stops recognizing the reviewer at all. Both directions are wrong, and
the first is the dangerous one, because a rule that matched nothing looks exactly like a rule with
nothing to match.

**The trim is an allowance for one bot account spelled two ways, so it takes a bot account.** GitHub
mints the login `foo[bot]` for an app whose slug is `foo`, while the bare `foo` stays an ordinary
user or organization name. Trimming whatever a surface reports therefore adds exactly one
human-reachable login per configured entry: a person or organization named `greptileai` would denote
the reviewer configured as `greptileai[bot]`, and every consumer of this contract would take that
account's comments and threads for the reviewer's output. Requiring the account class costs nothing
the trim exists for, because the two surfaces that disagree about the suffix both state that class —
`__typename: Bot` on GraphQL, `type: Bot` on REST — and the suffix itself is what forces
`isBot: true` where a payload states no class at all.

**A refused match fails towards not started.** A configured reviewer that matches no reported login
has no comment, no thread and no check attributed to it, so rule 3 below resolves it to **not
started** — which is this contract's own doctrine, that anything unprovable counts as not started,
applied one step earlier. A gate then blocks the merge and names that reviewer; a guard holds nothing
on it. **Forgejo is where that is visible.** It states no account class at all, so a **bare** Forgejo
login no longer matches a configured `X[bot]` entry and that reviewer stays **not started** however
recently it wrote. A Forgejo login that carries the suffix itself is unaffected, because the suffix
forces `isBot: true`. Forgejo's gate is report-only by construction — `pr-status-read`,
`pr-checks-wait` and `pr-merge` are all unsupported there — so what the strict comparison costs there
is a noisier report, never a wrong merge.

**Resolution runs from the reported login to the configured entry, and the configured spelling stays
the key.** `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` and `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check` are dotted
configuration keys spelled the way the project wrote them, so a reported `greptile-apps` resolves to
a configured `greptile-apps[bot]` entry and every following `.trigger` and `.check` lookup uses that
**configured spelling**. Matching tolerantly and then looking configuration up under the reported
spelling would find nothing, which is the same defect one step later.

**Two entries that collapse to one reviewer are one reviewer.** Two configured entries collapse when
they are equal after trimming one trailing `[bot]` off each. That is the same string comparison this
section applies between a configured and a reported login, but it neither carries nor needs the
account-class condition: collapse is decided before any read, and a configuration table states no
account class to condition on. It needs none because a pair collapses only when one of the two
spellings carries `[bot]` and therefore names the bot form of the other — two rows, two spellings of
one bot account, whatever a surface later reports about either. A project may already list both
spellings as a workaround; after this rule they
de-duplicate to a single reviewer, which is the intended outcome — one round, one mention, one wait.
**The surviving key is the first of the collapsing entries in `mergeGate.bots` list order**, and
every `.trigger` and `.check` lookup for that reviewer uses that one configured spelling. A value set
on exactly one of them is adopted for the collapsed reviewer: an unset key disagrees with nothing.
Report the collapse, so a maintainer can drop the redundant entry instead of keeping a line that no
longer does anything. If both entries set the same key to **different** values, that is a
configuration conflict. Report it naming the key and both values, and treat that reviewer as
unconfigured for triggering and for check lookup: post no trigger, and resolve its state without the
primary signal of rule 1. A gate then blocks the merge on that reviewer. Never pick one of the two
values and never combine them — a guessed trigger text and a guessed check context each decide a
different action, and neither is the one the project configured.

### The three states

- **running** — the reviewer is in flight for the current head. Its output is coming, and it must not
  be asked to start again.
- **not started** — nothing proves the reviewer has begun for the current head.
- **has run** — the reviewer has produced its verdict for the current head.

**running** and **not started** both mean the reviewer's output for this head is not there yet; they
differ only in what a consumer may do about it. Only the primary signal below can establish
**running** — a consumer that receives **not started** therefore learns that nothing is proven, not
that nothing is happening.

### Precedence

Resolve the state per reviewer, in this order, and stop at the first rule that resolves it.

1. **A configured check context — the primary signal.** When `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check` is set,
   look its value up in the normalized `checks` array of the same `pr-status-read` that supplied the
   head. Match it against an entry's `name` field: compare the whole value after trimming surrounding
   whitespace, and let no other field of the entry take part. A commit-status context and a check-run
   name arrive in that one field alike, so a status context such as `recensor/review` and the name of
   a workflow job are looked up identically and need no distinction here.
   - a matching entry with `status: PENDING` → **running**;
   - a matching entry with `status: COMPLETED` → **has run**, whatever its `conclusion`. A red review
     is a review: the conclusion states what the reviewer found, not whether it ran, and reading it
     as "has not run" would trigger a reviewer that already answered.
   - **no matching entry in a reported list** → **not started**. A context that never appears is
     indistinguishable from one that is about to appear: a misconfigured value, an app that is not
     installed, and a queued run whose status is only set once a worker claims it all look the same
     from here.
   - **no list at all** is a different case. When `pr-status-read` reports `checksReported: false`,
     the primary signal is unavailable rather than negative, and the reviewer falls through to rule 2.
     Forgejo exposes no such rollup, so every reviewer of a Forgejo pull request takes the fallback
     path however carefully its `.check` is configured.
2. **`createdAt` versus `headCommittedAt` — the fallback.** It applies to a reviewer with no
   configured `.check`, and to one whose primary signal was unavailable. Compare the `createdAt` of
   that login's newest comment, review thread, or thread reply against `headCommittedAt` from
   `pr-status-read`; both are RFC-3339 strings and are compared as instants, never as text. A
   `createdAt` later than `headCommittedAt` → **has run**. Otherwise, and whenever either value is
   absent, → **not started**.
   - **This rule never reports running**, and a consumer must not read it as if it could. It observes
     output, and a reviewer that has started without writing yet is indistinguishable from one that
     has not started at all. The fallback therefore separates **has run** from **not started** and
     says nothing whatsoever about what is in flight.
   - A reviewer that edits one sticky comment in place keeps its original `createdAt`, so its second
     review is invisible to this rule. That is the concrete reason the primary signal exists.
   - Emoji reactions are not readable through the helper and never count, whatever their timing. A
     reviewer that acknowledges that way has no usable signal on this path at all.
3. **Anything unprovable counts as not started.** A missing timestamp, a check context that never
   appears, an unreadable field, an author that cannot be established: none of them prove a run.
   Fail in this direction and in no other. What that costs differs by consumer: a gate pays a
   redundant trigger and a blocked merge whose reason it can name, while a guard pays the protection
   it would have given — an unprovable state holds no run. What the opposite direction costs is the
   same for both, and worse than either: a head nobody reviewed, merged.

### One read, one head

Observe every reviewer against **one** fresh read, and use the check list, `headCommittedAt`, and the
threads of exactly that read. A state assembled from two instants describes no state the pull request
ever had. The result belongs to that read's head SHA and to nothing else: a new commit invalidates it
for every reviewer, however recently it was observed.

### What each state permits

The state is shared; what it gates is not. Each entry therefore states what is true of the state
itself first, and what each consumer role does with it second.

- **has run** — the reviewer's output for this head exists and may be read, classified, and answered.
  A gate counts this reviewer's merge precondition as satisfied; a guard lets its run continue.
- **running** — the reviewer's output is coming, and no consumer may ask it to start again. A trigger
  aimed at a reviewer already working either queues a redundant second run or, for a reviewer that
  reads a mention as a fresh request, discards the one in flight. A gate waits and keeps the merge
  blocked until the state changes; a guard holds its run. Waiting is one bounded blocking wait
  followed by one re-read, never a poll loop.
- **not started** — nothing about this reviewer is proven for this head, and a configured trigger may
  be posted. A gate blocks the merge on it, because merging here would merge a head the reviewer
  never saw. A guard does **not** hold its run on it: a reviewer that may never start is nothing a
  run can usefully wait for. One state, two consequences, each correct for its consumer.

A consumer may additionally read a **not started** reviewer as in flight when a trigger comment for
that reviewer exists for this head — whoever posted it, an earlier gate round or a person by hand.
That is evidence about the request, not about the reviewer, which is why this contract keeps it out
of the state itself: a posted mention proves that someone asked, never that anything is running.

### Record the evidence, not only the state

Every consumer records, per reviewer, which rule resolved the state and the concrete value it read —
the check name with its status, the two timestamps, or the field that was missing. A merge this
contract blocks and a question it raises are explainable only with that; "the reviewer has not run"
without a reason sends someone looking in the wrong place.

### This narrows the window; it does not close it

A terminal check states that the reviewer finished, not that every thread it wrote has already
arrived — threads can land moments later. This contract makes that window small; closing it belongs
to the consumer, and each one closes it with a read of its own. Nothing here replaces that read, and
nothing here gates anything: this block observes state, and a merge is not its to hold.

Where each consumer discharges that obligation, so the two stay in step with this contract:

- **`{{SKILL:merge-gate}}`** in its Phase-4 merge preconditions. A thread that arrived after the
  round's own observation is one no round assessed, which blocks the merge and sends the run back
  for another round — the gate never merges past a reviewer finding nobody reached an outcome about.
- **`{{SKILL:iterate}}`** through the fresh read it performs before every write, which is what keeps
  a late thread out of a reply it would otherwise contradict.
