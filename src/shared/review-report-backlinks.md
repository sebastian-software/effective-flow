## Review-report backlinks

When this workflow implements a finding from an existing review-report file in `.effective-flow/review/`:

- before execution moves into any worktree, identify the absolute report handle; verify that it
  stays below `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT/.effective-flow/review/` and retain it unchanged
- immediately before changing the report, revalidate `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`, canonical containment,
  and repository identity, then apply the owning workflow's loaded “Runtime-state write safety”
  contract from the main checkout to that concrete report path; a block leaves it unchanged
- append to the affected finding, as the last entry, a short implementation note
- start the note with a green check mark, for example `✅ Implemented on YYYY-MM-DD via [current workflow]`
- update only the findings that were actually addressed by this workflow
- if several reports or findings are candidates, ask instead of marking indiscriminately
- never reconstruct a project-relative report path from `EXECUTION_ROOT` and never write a
  backlink into a same-named report in a delivery, native, or component worktree
