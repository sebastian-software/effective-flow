## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked truth for the Effective Flow configuration is a living ADR "Effective
Flow project setup" (default slug `effective-flow-project-setup`, see fragment "Living
ADR model"). It carries the config parameters with minimal prose as a **Markdown table**. There
is **no** `.effective-flow/config.json` as a config source anymore; `.effective-flow/` is a
pure runtime directory (`memory.json`, `cache.json`, `review/`, `.worktrees/`) and is
completely gitignored.

### Config locator (resolution order)

When reading the configuration, the project setup ADR is resolved in this order; the
first matching step wins:

1. **AGENTS.md marker.** The canonical line `**Effective Flow project setup:** <path>` in
   `AGENTS.md`, otherwise in `CLAUDE.md` or a comparable convention file → read the ADR
   under `<path>`. **Backcompat (one generation):** a still-present legacy marker
   `**Firmo project setup:** <path>` is recognized as equivalent on read; {{SKILL:setup}}
   converts it non-destructively to the new spelling on the next run. If the
   marker points to a path under which **no** ADR lives (dead/stale marker), do not stay
   there, but fall through in this order and report the stale marker
   (correction in {{SKILL:setup}}).
2. **Default path/scan.** Otherwise `docs/adr/effective-flow-project-setup.md` (the legacy slug
   `firmo-project-setup` is recognized as equivalent during the scan) or a scan of the detected
   ADR directory (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`) for the project setup ADR.
3. **Transitional compatibility.** Otherwise — only transitionally — establish or reuse the
   verified execution-location receipt and resolve the fallback from `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`: read
   a still-present absolute `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` handle (otherwise
   `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and point to {{SKILL:setup}}. Never inspect a
   same-named fallback below a linked `EXECUTION_ROOT`. A missing, bare, moved, unsafe, or
   repository-mismatched runtime root blocks the fallback. This read path creates **nothing**
   and touches **no** Git.
4. **Built-in defaults.** Otherwise use the defaults of the respective source skills.

The deterministic read path of any tool is non-blocking: It reads the ADR (or
the transitional fallback), but itself creates no file and mutates no Git. Creating
the ADR, the markers and the migration happen exclusively in the Git-touching path of
{{SKILL:setup}}.

### Table encoding (binding for writers and readers)

The config parameters stand as a flat Markdown table with two columns. Readers bootstrap before
they know the configured language by accepting both canonical envelopes: English
`## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |`, and German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. They likewise recognize `## Context`/`## Kontext`, `## Status`,
`Active`/`Aktiv` and `Superseded`/`Abgelöst`. The former German empty-list token `(leer)` is
accepted on legacy reads only. Config keys and newly written encoded values remain identical and
English in both envelopes, including `(empty)`. Writers ({{SKILL:setup}}, migration) and readers
(all tools) interpret values identically. A normal update preserves the existing ADR envelope
language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`.
- **String** → literal, unquoted (e.g. `focused`, `origin/main`).
- **`null`** (semantically "ask at run time", e.g. `applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy`) →
  the literal token `null`.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`.
- **Filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`,
  `skills.agents.ui-implementer.include`); an empty object has no sub-lines.
- **Missing line = key not set → default of the source skill.** Deliberately
  different from a present line with value `null` (an explicit value, semantically "ask at
  run time"). Example: no `delivery.completion` line → default `merge`; a
  `delivery.completion | null` line → ask at run time.
- **`delivery.prReview`** → the literal string `ask` (default), `always`, or `off`; it governs the
  automatic PR review publication after a delivery. No `delivery.prReview` line → default `ask`,
  per the rule above.
- **`tracker.externalStartedState`** → a nullable string containing the external connection's stable
  state ID, or its exact accepted token only when that connection exposes no ID. Missing or `null`
  means unset and never authorizes a guessed transition. Readers validate a non-null value against a
  fresh list of writable states in the exact configured tracker context before every implementation
  run; stale, terminal, read-only, cross-context, and display-name-only matches fail closed before
  code. Only `{{SKILL:setup}}` writes a confirmed tracker-verified suggestion. The fixed post-merge
  observation grace period has no configuration key.

Reading a single value is a trivial line lookup (line with dotted key →
value cell). Example excerpt (interface sketch, not full content):

```markdown
## Configuration

| Key                         | Value    |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| review.profile                    | focused |
| applyReview.defaultCommitStrategy | null    |
| skills.exclude                    | (empty)  |
| worktree.enabled                  | true    |
```

If the table is invalid or ambiguous (missing key, unknown encoding): use a
safe default for the run, inform the user about the affected key,
do **not** guess.

### Merge-gate keys (`mergeGate.*`) and their legacy namespace

{{SKILL:merge-gate}} reads the keys below; {{SKILL:iterate}} reads the `bots` entries for its
review-in-flight guard. A missing line means the default, per the encoding rule above.

| Key                              | Values                             | Default   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `mergeGate.completion`           | `ask`, `merge`, `report`           | `ask`     |
| `mergeGate.conflictResolution`   | `off`, `ask`, `auto`               | `auto`    |
| `mergeGate.requireAllChecks`     | `true`, `false`                    | `true`    |
| `mergeGate.checkWaitMinutes`     | positive integer                   | `20`      |
| `mergeGate.maxRounds`            | positive integer                   | `3`       |
| `mergeGate.botWaitMinutes`       | positive integer                   | `10`      |
| `mergeGate.bots`                 | comma list of logins               | `(empty)` |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.trigger` | literal trigger comment text       | unset     |
| `mergeGate.bots.<login>.check`   | commit-status or check-run context | unset     |

A login containing brackets (`greptileai[bot]`) is a valid middle segment, because the encoding
splits on `.` only.

**`mergeGate.conflictResolution` is new and has no `prReview.*` predecessor.** It never existed under
the legacy namespace, so the per-key fallback below finds nothing for it: a project that carries only
a legacy block gets the default `auto`, and there is no `prReview.conflictResolution` row to read,
migrate, or report as shadowed. `auto` resolves a conflict with the base through
{{SKILL:merge-gate}}'s dedicated worker, `ask` asks once **per conflicted round** in a gated run —
once per conflict rather than once per run, deliberately unlike `mergeGate.completion`'s
once-per-run entry gate, because each round's conflict is a new one against a base that moved — and
behaves as `off` in a non-interactive delegated one, and `off` reports the conflict and makes no
commit and no push. That last claim is about the branch: the gate provisions its checkout before it
reads this key, and cleans it up on the same stop path.

**An unreadable or invalid `mergeGate.conflictResolution` resolves to `off`, not to `auto`.** The
general rule above says to use a safe default for the run; for every other key in this block the safe
default and the documented default are the same value, and for this one they are not — an
unparseable line must never authorize a commit and a push. Report the affected key as that rule
requires and continue with `off`.

**Backcompat (one generation):** these keys were formerly named `prReview.*`. Where a
`mergeGate.<key>` line is absent, read `prReview.<key>` and use its value; report **once per run**
that the legacy namespace was read and that {{SKILL:setup}} migrates it. Precedence is per key: a
present `mergeGate.<key>` always wins over a present `prReview.<key>`, and the two namespaces are
never merged at a finer grain than the individual key. Reading is all this fallback does — only
{{SKILL:setup}} writes configuration, and it rewrites a legacy block in place (carry the values
over, remove the old rows, report a shadowed key). Once every project has run {{SKILL:setup}} once,
the fallback has no remaining reader and is removable rather than load-bearing.

**`delivery.prReview` is not part of this block** and is never migrated: it decides whether a run
publishes **its own review findings** onto a pull request it created (see the encoding rule above),
while `mergeGate.*` configures the gate that takes an **existing** pull request from open to merged.

### Language configuration and compatibility migration

The supported language keys and their surface mapping live only in the shared "Language
resolution" fragment. This configuration contract accepts `language.project`,
`language.source`, `language.documentation.user`, `language.documentation.technical`,
`language.workflow`, `language.forge`, and `language.git`; every value is `de` or `en`.
Missing overrides inherit `language.project`, and a missing project language resolves to `en`.
Invalid values are ignored with a diagnostic and never guessed.

`plan.markerLanguage` is a legacy read/migration key, not part of the current schema. If
`language.workflow` is absent, {{SKILL:setup}} may propose migrating a valid legacy `de`/`en`
value to `language.workflow`; an existing `language.workflow` always wins. Show explicitly that
the old marker-only setting becomes the language of the complete workflow artifact. Apply the
addition and removal only in the confirmed before/after write step. Preserve the legacy key if
the write is not confirmed, and never emit it in a new configuration.

If neither language keys nor the legacy key exist, {{SKILL:setup}} may propose the read-only
plan-corpus fallback defined by "Language resolution" as `language.workflow`, but only when
prose, fields, and markers consistently identify one language. Mixed, contradictory, or empty
plan sets are not migrated. This compatibility path must be reported and confirmed like every
other config change.

### One-time migration legacy `config.json` → project setup ADR

The migration of an existing `.effective-flow/config.json` or legacy `.firmo/config.json`
into the project setup ADR is **Git-touching** and runs exclusively in the
{{SKILL:setup}} path. It produces the ADR table from the current config content (encoding
as above), writes the AGENTS.md marker `**Effective Flow project setup:**`, switches
`.gitignore` to a single `.effective-flow/` and untracks the legacy `config.json`
(`git rm --cached`, leave the file content on disk). The exact procedure including
idempotency marking is in {{SKILL:setup}}.

Outside {{SKILL:setup}}, **no** migration takes place: The deterministic
read path creates nothing and touches no Git; on a missing ADR it reads instead a
still-present `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/config.json` (otherwise
`<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.firmo/config.json`) and points to {{SKILL:setup}}.
