## Effective Flow configuration (project setup ADR)

The tracked configuration is a living ADR "Effective Flow project setup" (default slug
`effective-flow-project-setup`) carrying a Markdown key/value table; hidden mode keeps it in the
untracked `<RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT>/.effective-flow/project-setup.md`. `.effective-flow/` is otherwise
private, ignored runtime state, and no `config.json` is a configuration source.

### Config locator (resolution call)

Before the first configuration-dependent step, run
`node <skill-root>/scripts/config-resolve.mjs resolve` with one JSON object on standard input:
`cwd` (the checkout this run works in), `tool` (this tool's own name, e.g. `refactor`; an internal
source such as `apply-plan` passes its own), and `mode` for `iterate` (`local`/`pr`) and
`apply-review` (`local`/`remote`). The script runs the whole config locator (steps 0–4), decodes
the table, forces the hidden-mode values, and classifies retired rows; never read the ADR by hand.
Fail closed: a missing Node, a nonzero exit, or anything but one parseable envelope line
`{ ok, operation, data }` stops the run before that step, reporting the cause. Exit 3
(`RUNTIME_ROOT_UNVERIFIED`, `RUNTIME_STATE_UNSAFE`) stops with the reported check and no write,
never continuing in standard mode. `data.runtimeStateRoot` is the verified `RUNTIME_STATE_ROOT`
(`null` outside Git), `data.visibility` is `standard` or `hidden`, and `data.source` names the
resolving step and path.

### Acting on the result

- **Values** come only from `data.values[<key>]`: `value` is decoded (`true`/`false`, `null`, `[]`
  for `(empty)`, else the literal string) and `items` is the comma-split list. An absent key or
  `state: unset` is not set → the owning tool's default; `value: null` is explicit and means "ask
  at run time" (no `delivery.completion` → default `merge`; `delivery.completion | null` → ask).
  For `state: invalid`, or a value the owning tool cannot interpret, use a safe default for the
  run, name the key to the user, and do **not** guess.
- **`executionProfiles.fast.enabled`** → its `profile`. `disabled` (missing row or literal `false`)
  and `invalid` (malformed, ambiguous, or unreadable) select Quality and stop new measurement
  without rewriting persisted pilot-generation state. `enabled` (only the literal `true`) admits
  the project to the pilot lifecycle but does not start a baseline, activate a generation, prove
  native Fast capability, or itself permit Fast. Only Guided setup (advanced block 10) sets it;
  Profile and Express preserve an existing value and never enable it. It has no legacy migration
  and names no provider model.
- **`delivery.prReview`** → `ask`, `always`, or `off`; unset resolves to `ask`. What it governs is
  the owning workflow's.
- **Diagnostics** (`data.diagnostics[].code`): `unknown-tool` needs nothing; every other code is
  reported once per run. `dead-marker`, `legacy-marker`, `marker-divergence`, `legacy-slug`,
  `transitional-fallback`, and `legacy-empty-token` also point to {{SKILL:setup}}; `several-match`
  names every listed path, and a run that writes configuration (`writerStop`) ends there;
  `ambiguous-key` and `invalid-value` take the safe default above.
- **Retired rows (retired-key rule).** Each `data.retired` entry names a retired row and its
  successor. `stop` ends the run, naming both keys and {{SKILL:setup}}, and never takes the
  successor's default — the one exception to the safe-default rule; `report` is reported once and
  points to {{SKILL:setup}} while the successor wins; `none` needs nothing. Only a `stop` entry with
  `conditional: reviewer-resolved` is downgraded to one report when the run resolves no reviewer
  matching its `normalizedLogin` under "Matching a configured login"; the conditional never changes
  `report` or `none`.

```lazy-include
config-migration-edge-cases
when: `data.visibility` is `hidden`, a `data.retired` entry's action is `stop` or `report`, or a `tracker.mode: external` run resolves `tracker.externalStartedState` or `tracker.externalDoneState`
```

### Table encoding (binding for writers)

Reading creates no file and mutates no Git; only {{SKILL:setup}} creates or changes the ADR, the
markers, the local hidden configuration, and the migration. It writes a flat two-column table
under English `## Configuration` with `| Key | Value |` or German `## Konfiguration` with
`| Schlüssel | Wert |`. Keys and encoded values stay English in both envelopes, and a normal update
preserves the existing envelope language; changing `language.documentation.technical` does not
translate an existing ADR.

- **Boolean** → `true` / `false`; **String** → literal and unquoted (e.g. `origin/main`).
- **`null`** → the literal token `null`; a missing row means the key is not set.
- **Empty list** → `(empty)`; **filled list** → comma-separated (e.g. `humanizer, distill`).
- **Nesting** → dotted keys (e.g. `applyReview.worktree.baseDir`); an empty object has no rows.
