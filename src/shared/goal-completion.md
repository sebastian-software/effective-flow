## Goal-driven completion control

Internal "repeat until done" loops of this workflow follow a uniform completion pattern instead of an ad-hoc formulated loop. The pattern pairs one declared completion goal with independent verification and visible progress control. It steers the workflow's own run, and the workflow's regular approval gates always apply.

### Goal controls

1. **Declare the completion condition up front.** Before the implementation work begins, formulate exactly one explicit, measurable completion condition. Derive it from the acceptance criteria and the validation plan of the basis (plan file, diagnosis or agreed scope). A good condition names the target state, the concrete check and the scope boundary – i.e. also what is deliberately not changed.
2. **Verify independently.** Do not check the condition by self-assessment, but via the independent instances anyway provided for it: `{{AGENT:code-validator}}` for technical checks and the appropriate reviewer for content ones. The condition counts as fulfilled only once these instances confirm it.
3. **Loop with a bound.** If verification does not confirm the condition, fix the cause and verify again. Bound the internal correction rounds (guideline: three). If the condition still does not hold afterwards, abort the internal loop and escalate to the user instead of running on indefinitely – approach as in the retry escalation of the done protocol.
4. **Visible progress.** Every run keeps a visible phase task list and concise chat updates even when only a few phases remain; the generic task-tracking thresholds govern only ad-hoc subtask lists and never this overview. Whatever task tooling the harness offers must produce these guarantees:
   - Exactly one workflow owns the progress overview: `{{FLOW}} apply-plan` hands ownership to its target workflow before that workflow's phases begin; `{{FLOW}} apply-issues` and `{{FLOW}} apply-review` retain ownership; a delegated subworkflow reports instead of a second progress overview.
   - Before work, list every known remaining numbered phase; add findings, issues or parallel subtasks as soon as their set is known; on resume, continue the existing list; keep more specific per-finding, per-issue, per-source and per-reviewer rules authoritative.
   - After each numbered phase and correction round, post a short update with its result and next step; these updates are not gates, so continue unless an existing approval rule or a genuine blocker requires input.
   - Mark skipped, terminally failed and aborted steps as such; keep a step awaiting user input open with its blocker; never treat terminal failure or abort as satisfying the completion condition.
   - If tracking fails irrecoverably, report that failure once, move still-open tracking to chat without claiming a successful tool update, and continue the domain work.
   - Before reporting completion, reconcile every known phase and dynamic entry to a truthful visible end state; never report completion with an unresolved entry.
