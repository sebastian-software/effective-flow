## Goal-driven completion control

Internal "repeat until done" loops of this workflow follow a uniform goal pattern instead of an ad-hoc formulated loop. The pattern adopts the three principles of the native `/goal` (Codex and Claude Code). At explicit goal gates, the directly following central `goal-start-action` fragment renders the action after an authorized autonomous choice per harness.

### The three principles

1. **Declare the completion condition up front.** Before the implementation work begins, formulate exactly one explicit, measurable completion condition. Derive it from the acceptance criteria and the validation plan of the basis (plan file, diagnosis or agreed scope). A good condition names the target state, the concrete check and the scope boundary – i.e. also what is deliberately not changed.
2. **Verify independently.** Do not check the condition by self-assessment, but via the independent instances anyway provided for it: `{{AGENT:code-validator}}` for technical checks and the appropriate reviewer for content ones. The condition counts as fulfilled only once these instances confirm it.
3. **Loop with a bound.** If verification does not confirm the condition, fix the cause and verify again. Bound the internal correction rounds (guideline: three). If the condition still does not hold afterwards, abort the internal loop and escalate to the user instead of running on indefinitely – approach as in the retry escalation of the done protocol.

### Explicit goal query for autonomous runs

At the approval boundary of this workflow – where the completion condition is already fixed and the workflow is waiting for approval anyway – the user gets an **explicit choice** whether the remaining phases continue gated or autonomously under the native `/goal`. This replaces the earlier passive co-emitting of a `/goal` string: the option is actively queried, not merely offered. Workflows with this explicit gate include the central `goal-start-action` fragment directly after this control fragment.

#### When the query is omitted

Skip the goal query entirely (no extra option, no goal-start action and no `/goal` string) when the workflow runs as a **non-interactive sub-agent** of a superordinate orchestrator where no direct user interaction is intended – recognizable from the invocation context, for example "[Context from {{FIRMO}} apply-review: …]". `{{FIRMO}} apply-review` already steers its autonomous run at its own gate; an additional goal query per sub-delegation would be pointless there. Direct invocations and the handover through `{{FIRMO}} apply-plan` (interactive, individual) do **not** count as such delegation – there the goal query is retained.

#### Form of the query

- If the approval boundary is a yes/no approval, extend the approval question with a third option "Autonomous via `/goal`" next to "Yes" (continue gated) and "Adjust".
- If the approval boundary is a selection question (e.g. update groups) or if there is no yes/no approval at this boundary (e.g. because a planning phase was skipped), directly ask a concise standalone follow-up question "Run the remaining phases autonomously under `/goal`?". Depending on the interaction surface, use either yes/no answers or the explicit options "Continue gated" and "Autonomous via `/goal`".
- At the three-option approval gate, only "Autonomous via `/goal`" authorizes the harness-specific goal-start action; "Yes" continues gated and "Adjust" returns to clarification.
- At the standalone follow-up question, "Yes" or "Autonomous via `/goal`" authorizes the harness-specific goal-start action; "No" or "Continue gated" continues gated.
- No other response and no omitted query authorizes the goal-start action. On every gated path, **no** `/goal` string is emitted. The internal approval gates are retained in any case.

Rules for the `/goal` prompt and its objective in every harness path:

- **Self-sustaining:** Reference the underlying plan file, if present, and instruct to run through the remaining phases of this workflow – not "somehow make the criteria green".
- **Measurable:** Name the completion condition with the checks actually provided in the respective workflow (e.g. acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green and – if the workflow has a review phase – reviewer without open critical findings) and the scope boundary. Leave out checks that do not apply.
- **Platform-neutral objective:** Restrict yourself to the condition text after `/goal `; that exact text is both the direct Codex `objective` and the objective in every prompt handoff or fallback.
- **Only at gate-free boundaries:** Offer the autonomous run exclusively at approval boundaries after which no further approval gate follows, so an autonomous run does not get stuck at a later gate.

Form (replace placeholders, single line):

```text
/goal Fully implement <plan file or agreed task> and run through the remaining phases of this workflow: all acceptance criteria fulfilled, project-configured checks green<, reviewer without open critical findings – only if the workflow has a review phase>. Change nothing outside the scope. Stop when all criteria hold.
```
