## Completion protocol

When you use internal sub-agents, give them this response protocol:

- `DONE` for fully completed
- `ABORT: [reason]` for not completable

Check by the orchestrator:

1. `DONE`: phase completed.
2. `ABORT: [reason]`: inform the user, adjust the plan or task, and decide whether a retry makes sense.
3. No keyword: resume once, then retry with escalation.

### Retry escalation

When an internal sub-agent ends without `DONE` or `ABORT`, its result counts as not finished rather than as a failed attempt. First resume the same sub-agent once — with its context intact where the harness allows — and a continuation hint to await any pending children and end with `DONE` or `ABORT`. That resume is not a retry. If the harness cannot resume that sub-agent, or the resumed run again ends without a keyword, escalate:

1. Retry 1: same task with a continuation hint
2. Retry 2: simplified task with reduced scope
3. Retry 3: minimal task for only the most critical subtask
4. After 3 failed attempts:
   - inform the user
   - clarify the options as free text: complete manually, continue with the next phase, abort the workflow
