## Interactive output language

**Resolve `language.chat` once, before this run's first interactive output, and hold it for the
whole run.** It is `de` or `en`; there is no `auto`, and a missing row means **mirror the user's
language**, never inherit `language.project`. Precedence: an explicit in-message request, then a
configured value, then the conversation language, then `language.project`, then `en`. An invalid
value is reported and treated as an absent row — mirror, not a jump to `language.project`.

Scope is every interactive output: free prose, status updates, completion reports, an `ask` block's header,
question, option labels and descriptions, the next-steps heading and each option's description (never its
invocation token), and the session-title label, though a reused artifact title keeps its own. Encoded values
stay verbatim inside translated prose — the description `delivery.prReview = always — post the findings
without asking` is posed in German as `delivery.prReview = always — Ergebnisse ohne Rückfrage posten`.

Delegated output is relayed **verbatim**: this key is not handed down, so worker reports and agent
notices arrive as written and only the orchestrator's framing follows it — a run may be visibly
bilingual. The router catalog, `{{SKILL:version}}` and the `pr-review` notice precede any config
read and stay on the conversation language.
