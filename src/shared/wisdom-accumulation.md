## Wisdom Accumulation

At the start, generate a session ID (e.g. via timestamp `date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`) and use it consistently for the wisdom file `.effective-flow/.wisdom-accumulation-<SESSION_ID>.tmp.md`. This prevents collisions with parallel runs.

Contents:

- discarded root-cause hypotheses
- reproduction steps and results
- discovered dependencies and side effects
- wrong assumptions

After each phase, write a summary and pass it on to later phases. Delete the file at the end.
