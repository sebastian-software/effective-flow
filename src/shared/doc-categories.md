## Doc categories

Final documents from the documentation workflow are placed exclusively in one of the four fixed categories under `docs/`.

| Category        | Directory               | Audience                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User guide      | `docs/user-guide/`      | End users of the application                                    |
| Developer guide | `docs/developer-guide/` | Developers who contribute to the project                        |
| Operations      | `docs/operations/`      | Operations, deployment, monitoring, infrastructure              |
| Runbooks        | `docs/runbooks/`        | Step-by-step procedures for incident response and routine tasks |

### Prescribed standard doc structure

Unless the user or the underlying plan specifies otherwise, this **standard structure** of
three roles applies to the project documentation. It is a prose default: the documentation
workflow applies it when no different structure is required; an explicit wish of the user
(e.g. a purely technical README without marketing) always takes precedence. There is **no**
config field for this.

Resolve documentation language by target: root `README.md` and `docs/user-guide/**` use
`language.documentation.user`; `docs/developer-guide/**`, `docs/operations/**`,
`docs/runbooks/**`, standalone API documentation, and new ADRs use
`language.documentation.technical`; in-code documentation uses `language.source`; explicit
changelog/release prose uses `language.git`. Existing documents preserve their clear language
unless translation was explicitly requested. File/directory names and category values remain
stable and are not translated.

1. **Root `README.md` – marketing entry point.** A marketing page entirely from the user's
   perspective: value proposition first, promotional language allowed, kept short. It is
   created by the marketing agent (not by the factual documentation agent) and applies the
   conditional follow-up-link rule below.
2. **User documentation → `docs/user-guide/`.** Entirely from the user's perspective:
   describes installation and usage extensively, optionally with an FAQ and similar additions.
   The entry point is `docs/user-guide/README.md`.
3. **Technical documentation → `docs/developer-guide/`.** For developers and software
   architects: developers get an overview of the software, software architects can derive from
   it whether the software should be used from a technical standpoint. The entry point is
   `docs/developer-guide/README.md`.

**Conditional follow-up-link rule for the root README.** At the end of the documentation run,
inspect whether `docs/user-guide/README.md` and `docs/developer-guide/README.md` exist. The
final documentation follow-up section of the root `README.md` includes only links whose targets
exist, in user-guide then developer-guide order:

- If both targets exist at the end of the run, the section contains exactly two links:
  first `docs/user-guide/README.md`, then `docs/developer-guide/README.md`.
- If exactly one target exists, the section contains only that target's valid link. Report the
  other path as an open point in the workflow or agent result.
- If neither target exists, emit neither link. Report both missing paths individually as open
  points in the workflow or agent result.

Never add a placeholder or broken link for a missing target. Preserve existing unrelated
README links; they are outside the final documentation follow-up section and do not count
toward this invariant.

### File name convention

- topic-based slugs in kebab-case, e.g. `installation.md`, `architecture.md`, `restart-database.md`
- no date or number prefix; the date-slug scheme (with a preserved legacy number) is exclusive to the plan directory `<plan.dir>/` (from `plan.dir` of the Effective Flow configuration/project-setup ADR, default `docs/plan`)
- slugs must be unique within their category
- file extension always `.md`

### Directory rules

- `docs/user-guide/README.md` as a curated entry point with a reading order is mandatory as soon as at least one user-guide document exists.
- `docs/developer-guide/README.md` as a curated entry point is mandatory as soon as at least one developer-guide document exists. It gives developers an overview and software architects a basis for decision-making, and is the target of the developer-guide follow-up link when that link is included under the conditional rule (see "Prescribed standard doc structure").
- `docs/operations/` and `docs/runbooks/` have no README by default.
- In `docs/runbooks/`, thematic subfolders are allowed, e.g. `docs/runbooks/database/restart.md`. They are optional; mandatory only once the flat list becomes unwieldy.
- Empty directories are not created in advance. A category directory comes into being only with the first document in it.

### Write boundary

- The documentation workflow may write final documents exclusively into these four directories and their subfolders.
- **Exception root `README.md`:** As the marketing entry point of the standard doc structure, the root `README.md` is a sanctioned write target of the documentation workflow and does not need to be named individually in every plan table for that. It is written exclusively in this marketing-entry-point role; if a root README already exists, it is not silently overwritten but the replacement is clarified with the user (analogous to the collision rule for existing target paths).
- Every **other** existing file outside these directories may only be changed if it is explicitly named in the `Affected files` table of the underlying plan file.

### Plan headers for documentation plans

Plan files with `**Empfohlener Workflow:** Documentation` or
`**Recommended workflow:** Documentation` additionally contain the matching two lines directly
under the workflow recommendation:

- German: `**Doku-Kategorie:** user-guide | developer-guide | operations | runbooks` and
  `**Ziel-Pfad:** docs/<category>/<topic-slug>.md`
- English: `**Doc category:** user-guide | developer-guide | operations | runbooks` and
  `**Target path:** docs/<category>/<topic-slug>.md`

Rules:

- Both lines must use the complete plan language and be written exactly as above, including bold
  formatting, colon, and lowercasing of the stable category value.
- The category field must match the directory prefix in the target-path field.
- The target path must point to a file within the matching category directory.
- Example: `**Doku-Kategorie:** runbooks` with `**Ziel-Pfad:** docs/runbooks/database/restart.md`,
  or the complete English equivalent.
- **Special case marketing entry point:** If the documentation plan targets the root `README.md`,
  the matching target-path field contains `README.md` and the doc-category line is omitted – the
  root README is not one of the four `docs/` categories. Only in exactly this case may the
  category line be absent.
