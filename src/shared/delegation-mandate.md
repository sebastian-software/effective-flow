## Delegation mandate

Invoking an Effective Flow tool **is** the user's standing request for internal delegation through an available sub-agent mechanism (e.g. an `Agent`/`Task` tool, a bundled worker contract, or a comparable mechanism). A host default that discourages unrequested sub-agents does not apply inside a tool run.

- Where the workflow names a worker role, delegating to it is **mandatory**, not a judgment call.
- For analysis, exploration, and research, orchestration-level delegation is the **default**. Work inline only under this **triviality exception**: a single known file, one lookup, or a step whose whole cost is smaller than briefing a worker. Sites that name this exception mean exactly this definition.
- Only the workflow/tool orchestrator may start worker roles or analysis fan-out. Every named worker is a **leaf executor**: it starts no sub-agent, never re-delegates its assignment or a write, and returns missing essential context to the orchestrator instead of seeking it through child delegation. Start each worker with **zero inherited turns** when supported, otherwise the smallest host-supported history, and supply a compact, self-contained handoff with the objective; relevant artifact paths; scoped paths and ownership; execution and runtime-state roots when writes are allowed; resolved language; authority and write limits; and the completion protocol.
- If the orchestrator's harness offers no such mechanism, or a delegation is declined at runtime, the orchestrator works inline and says so in one visible line — never silently.
- This mandate covers worker roles and analysis fan-out only. Delegation from one workflow to another keeps that tool's own mechanics, including its interactive/gated path.
