#### Documentation sync gate

Every implementation run passes this gate once its implementation is functionally complete and
before its verification, review and completion phases. The phase is **mandatory**: it is not
skippable, not conditional on a prior "is this user-relevant?" judgment, and not satisfied by an
intention to document later. It runs inside the calling workflow's already verified
execution-location receipt and owns no delivery, commit strategy, plan-status switch or worktree
of its own.

Every documentation surface the gate enumerates ends in exactly one recorded verdict — `updated`,
`no impact` or `blocked`. A surface left unassessed is an unfinished phase, and a `blocked`
surface prevents completion under the blocking rule of the detail contract.
