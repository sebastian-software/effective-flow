## Investigation method

This building block describes the read-only core of a bug and behavior investigation. The investigation steps described here are themselves read-only: they change no code and write no tests; a reproduction happens within these steps only through observation – running existing checks, describing logs and behavior – or through a documented reproduction guide. Whether the embedding workflow additionally produces a reproduction test is decided by that workflow itself (e.g. `{{SKILL:fix}}` additionally writes a failing test); `{{SKILL:investigate}}`, by contrast, stays fully read-only.

### Investigate symptom and code

1. Analyze the symptom or error description thoroughly: expected versus actual behavior.
2. Investigate the relevant code locally or via an internal Explore sub-agent – read-only.
3. Clarify open questions directly with the user:
   - when does the behavior occur
   - is there an error message or a clearly nameable expected versus actual behavior
   - since when has the behavior existed
4. Identify the suspected root cause and the affected files.

### Diagnosis validation

Assess the diagnosis with a scorecard before making a follow-up decision:

- **Clarity:** root cause as well as file and line named concretely.
- **Verification:** behavior reproducible or described as a concrete reproduction guide.
- **Context:** assumptions explicitly marked, target <= 10 % guessing.
