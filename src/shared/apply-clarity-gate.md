## Clarification gate (fully clarified?)

Before a basis (plan file, issue, or review finding) is implemented, this
gate checks whether it is **fully clarified** and **implementable without a follow-up question**. The gate applies
at **both** entry points: in the apply chain (`{{SKILL:apply}}` →
`{{SKILL:apply-plan}}`/`{{SKILL:apply-issues}}`/`{{SKILL:apply-review}}`) **and** on
direct invocation of an implementing workflow (`{{SKILL:build}}`, `{{SKILL:fix}}`,
`{{SKILL:refactor}}`, `{{SKILL:docs}}`) with a plan file.

Guiding principle: **No assumptions except the absolutely obvious.** When in doubt, prefer one
clarification round too many over one too few.

### Abort criteria (at least one applies → do not implement)

- **Open points:** the plan contains an `## Offene Punkte` or canonical `## Open points` section
  with entries other than the empty state (`- Keine offenen Punkte.` / `- No open points.`).
  Continue to recognize the former English spelling `## Open Points` when reading existing plans.
- **Missing measurable acceptance criteria:** there are no acceptance criteria, or they are
  formulated without a named check/metric (no concrete check, no verifiable
  target state).
- **Implementation-relevant assumptions:** the plan contains uncertainties marked as assumptions that
  materially affect the behavior, scope, or risk of the implementation.
- **Not self-contained (issues/findings):** an issue or finding does not describe the
  intended implementation self-containedly enough to work through it without a follow-up question.

Pure, uncritical assumptions with no implementation relevance do not block.

### Behavior at the gate

- **Passed** (no criterion applies): continue to implementation. Before delegating, the
  orchestrating workflow resolves the concrete output language for every destination surface
  through the shared language rules and includes those `de`/`en` values in the agent task. The
  agent uses the supplied values and does not reinterpret project configuration.
- **Not passed:** briefly name the affected points, refer back to a clarification round,
  and end the current skill instead of partially implementing or guessing.
  Target skill of the clarification: a plan file goes to `{{SKILL:plan}}` or its in-depth
  plan review (`{{SKILL:review}} <planfile>`); an issue or finding goes to
  `{{SKILL:plan-issue}}`.

The gate replaces the former separate "check open points" check: where a workflow previously
ran this check on its own, this gate now serves as the single authoritative instance,
to avoid duplicate maintenance.
